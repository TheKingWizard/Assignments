A MESSENGER	
A Roman now adopted happily,	
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.	
A banish'd traitor.	
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.	
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well	
A braving war.	
A brother's murther! Pray can I not,	
A buzzing of a separation	
A camp at a short distance from Rome	
A caudle, ho!	
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,	
A churchyard.	
A city full; of tribunes such as you,	
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse	
A cold premeditation for my purpose!	
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate	
A credulous father! and a brother noble,	
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,	
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?	
A dateless lively heat still to endure,	
A day in April never came so sweet	
A dearer birth than this his love had brought	
A dozen captains stay at door for you.	
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear	
A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.	
A father to me; and thou hast created	
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,	
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius	
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers	
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,	
A foot of honour better than I was;	
A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with	
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,	
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys	
A glass that feated them; and to the graver	
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;	
A greater crack. The round world	
A hall in TIMON'S house	
A hall in the castle.	
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,	
A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.	
A hearty welcome.	
A human shape.	
A kinder value of the people than	
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.	
A lad of life, an imp of fame;	
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.	
A lawn before the DUKE'S palace	
A little cloth.	
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing	
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'	
A look untender! If't be summer news,	
A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;	
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.	
A man at least, for less I should not be;	
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly	
A man of great authority in France,	
A mark so bloody on the business; but	
A master-leaver and a fugitive!	
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.	
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell	
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey	
A most delicious banquet by his bed,	
A most poor issue?	
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus	
A night is but small breath and little pause	
A nobleness in record. But I will be	
A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.	
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;	
A plain in Warwickshire	
A pond as deep as hell.	
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.	
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.	
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung	
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King	
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.	
A quiet night, and my good mistress will	
A ragged and forestall'd remission.	
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel	
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit	
A room in the Castle.	
A room in the Garter Inn	
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,	
A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,	
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again	
A sly and constant knave,	
A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.	
A street.	
A sweet Athenian lady is in love	
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws	
A thing devised by the enemy.	
A thing of pity.	
A third is fled--that had a hand in it.	
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.	
A thousand talents to me.	
A thousand times in secret.	
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,	
A traitor to his God, his King, and him;	
A true man or a thief that gallops so?	
A very valiant Briton and a good,	
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd	
A virgin from her tender infancy,	
A visage of demand; for I do fear,	
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.	
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay	
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,	
A young and learned doctor to our court.	
AARON. Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.	
AARON. Lucius, save the child,	
AARON. Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.

AN OLD LADY, friend to Anne Bullen	
ANDROMACHE. Do not, dear father.

ANTONY. Neglected, rather;

ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,	
ANTONY. One word, sweet queen:	
ANTONY. She is cunning past man's thought.	
ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.	
ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,

Adieu, good Queen; I must attend on Caesar.	
Advantage feeds him fat while men delay.            Exeunt.	
Adventure to be banished myself;	
Affection is not rated from the heart;	
After his patient's death: the King already	
After that things are set in order here,	
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven	
Against my children, brothers, and myself-	
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,	
Against our borrowing prayers.	
Against our rampir'd gates and they shall ope,	
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.	
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me;	
Against the Greeks that would have ent'red Troy.	
Against the general enemy Ottoman.	
Against the part I come with; so I'll die	
Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,	
Against the word,	
Against their will. But who comes here?	
Against these giddy loose suggestions;	
Against this man-whose honesty the devil	
Agamemnon and all Greece.	
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,	
Ah wherefore with infection should he live,	
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know	
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;	
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!	
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,	
Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear;	
Alarum. Retreat. Enter Octavius, Antony, Messala,	
Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches.	
Alarums, excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET,	
Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,	
Alas! has banish'd me his bed already,	
Alas, my friend and my dear countryman	
Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for the dawning as we	
Alas, she hath from France too long been chas'd!	
Alb. But who was this?	
Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,	
Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;	
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.	
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel	
Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,	
Alexandria. CAESAR'S camp	
Alexandria. The monument	
Alisander- alas! you see how 'tis- a little o'erparted. But there	
Alive and dead; and for their brethren slain	
All books of love, see that at any hand;	
All causes to the purpose of his speed;	
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,	
All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,	
All long of this vile traitor Somerset.	
All losses are restored, and sorrows end.	
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:	
All must be even in our government.	
All my abilities in thy behalf.	
All my reports go with the modest truth;	
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.	
All souls that will be safe, fly from my side;	
All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten?	
All the argument is a whore and a cuckold-a good quarrel to draw	
All the quarters that they know	
All the remain is, welcome.                           Exeunt	
All the whole army stood agaz'd on him.	
All their petitions are as freely theirs	
All these and more we hazard by thy stay;	
Allaying both their fury and my passion	
Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,	
Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,	
Already smokes about the burning crest	
Although I did admit it as a motive	
Although my last; no matter, since I feel	
Although not valued to the money's worth.	
Although thy breath be rude.	
Although you break it when your pleasure serves.	
Am I both priest and clerk? Well then, amen.	
Am not I your Rosalind?	
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!	
Amen.	
Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking	
An act that very chance doth throw upon him-	
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue	
An ass's nole I fixed on his head.	
An awful rule, and right supremacy;	
An enemy to my son.- How now, Pisanio!	
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:	
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,	
An old man, broken with the storms of state,	
An ordinary groom is for such payment.	
An outward honour for an inward toil;	
An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,	
And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,	
And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief	
And Antenorides, with massy staples	
And Cassio kill'd?	
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,	
And Dromio my man did bring them me.	
And George, of Clarence; Warwick, as ourself,	
And God acquit them of their practices!	
And I a heavy interim shall support	
And I am proof against their enmity.	
And I am sent to tell his Majesty	
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.	
And I believe will never stand upright	
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.	
And I beseech you instantly to visit	
And I did give't my husband.	
And I embrace this fortune patiently,	
And I for my escape have put on his;	
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,	
And I in such a poverty of grace,	
And I myself secure in grace and favour.	
And I shall have no power to follow you.	
And I shall lose my life for want of language.	
And I will call hall to so strict account	
And I will do it without fear or doubt,	
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,	
And I will please you what you will demand.	
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.	
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,	
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof	
And In the morning early shall mine uncle	
And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford;	
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee	
And Phoebus 'gins arise,	
And Richard falls in height of all his pride.	
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.	
And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.	
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing;	
And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!	
And after we will both our judgments join	
And aid me with that store of power you have	
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,	
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.	
And all the ceremony of this compact	
And all the honours that can fly from us	
And all they foul that thy complexion lack.	
And all things answerable to this portion.	
And all things change them to the contrary.	
And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf	
And ample interchange of sweet discourse	
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore	
And as I am a gentleman I credit him.	
And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;	
And as the long divorce of steel falls on me	
And at his pleasure will resign my place.	
And at our stamp here, o'er and o'er one falls;	
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,	
And at the door too, like a post with packets.	
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away	
And bade me to dismiss you.	
And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!	
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes	
And batters down himself. What should I say?	
And be in debt to none- yet, more to move you,	
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;	
And be my heart an ever-burning hell!	
And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast	
And bear her women from the monument.	
And bear the palm for having bravely shed	
And being frank she lends to those are free:	
And between them and my Lord Chamberlain;	
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,	
And bid the snail-pac'd Ajax arm for shame.	
And blood of your begetting.	
And both against the peace of heaven and him	
And both for my sake lay on me this cross,	
And bound I am to Padua, there to visit	
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,	
And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know,	
And bring thee forth brave brood.	
And brought Prince Henry in their company;	
And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,	
And bury all which yet distinctly ranges	
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.             Exeunt	
And by and by I will to thee appear.                    Exit	
And by her presence still renew his sorrows.	
And by his treason stand'st not thou attainted,	
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queen,	
And by the second hour in the morning	
And by-and-by my master drew on him;	
And call the noblest to the audience.	
And call them shames, which are, indeed, nought else	
And call these foul offenders to their answers,	
And call upon my soul within the house;	
And can digest as much. Make no compare	
And careful hours with time's deformed hand	
And change you favours too; so shall your loves	
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.	
And cherish factions. 'Tis inferr'd to us	
And come to Padua, careless of your life!	
And cry myself awake? That's false to's bed,	
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,	
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's!	
And dispossess her all.	
And dispossessing all my other parts	
And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!	
And do not play in wench-like words with that	
And does he think so backwardly of me now	
And does the meanest chares. It were for me	
And drawing days out that men stand upon.	
And drown themselves in riot. Itches, blains,	
And dupp'd the chamber door,	
And each doth good turns now unto the other,	
And either end in peace- which God so frame!-	
And either victory or else a grave!	
And eke out our performance with your mind.             Exit	
And ever three parts coward,- I do not know	
And every day do honour to her grave.	
And every man hence to his idle bed;	
And every one his love-feat will advance	
And every true heart weeps for 't. All that dare	
And fall into our rustic revelry.	
And falls on the other.	
And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,	
And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,	
And fertile every wish, a million.	
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.         Exit	
And follow'd with a rabble that rejoice	
And follow'd with the general throng and sweat	
And follows close the rigour of the statute	
And for my self mine own worth do define,	
And for my soul, what can it do to that,	
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.	
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs,	
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect	
And for that name, which is no part of thee,	
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.	
And for the same he promis'd me a chain;	
And for this once my will shall stand for law.	
And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,	
And for thy life let justice be accus'd.	
And for thy treachery, what's more manifest	
And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.	
And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal	
And from her womb children of divers kind	
And from this swarm of fair advantages	
And from thy hated presence part I so;	
And gape at wid'st to glut him.	
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,	
And give assurance to Baptista Minola	
And give her to young Claudio.	
And give him chastisement for this abuse.	
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.	
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him	
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;	
And grant it may with thee in true peace live!	
And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;	
And had the tribute of his supple knee,	
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.	
And having both together heav'd it up,	
And he a prince, and ruler of the land;	
And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties	
And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,	
And he himself confess'd but even now	
And he himself will answer.	
And he knew my deceased father well.	
And he that is approved in this offense,	
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,	
And he that throws not up his cap for joy	
And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo	
And heavy-gaited toads, lie in their way,	
And here I swear by all the Roman gods-	
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,	
And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord!	
And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;	
And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.	
And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside	
And his love Thisby; very tragical mirth.'	
And his opinion. Now I change my mind,	
And his own courses will denote him so	
And his physicians fear him mightily.	
And his unbookish jealousy must construe	
And hold me pace in deep experiments.	
And hold thee to my heart.	
And hold their level with thy princely heart?	
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,	
And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,	
And hurt my brother.	
And if I die to-morrow this is hers,	
And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him	
And if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock,	
And if you love me, as you say you do,	
And in his ear I'll holloa 'Mortimer.'	
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil	
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.	
And in our name, what she requires; add more,	
And in submission will attend on her.	
And in that chair where kings and queens were crown'd;	
And in the Capitol and Senate's right,	
And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice,	
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since	
And in the calmest and most stillest night,	
And in the essential vesture of creation	
And in the instant that I met with you	
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,	
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.	
And in the spirit of men there is no blood.	
And in the witness of his proper ear,	
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal'd bit	
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.	
And issue forth and bid them battle straight.	
And it shall be as all the ocean,	
And it were better parch in Afric sun	
And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend.	
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,	
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.	
And knit our powers to the arm of peace.	
And know their spring, their head, their true descent;	
And lasting in her sad remembrance.	
And lay those honours on your high desert.	
And leave me to this miserable death.	
And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd.	
And left behind him Richard, his only son,	
And let belief and life encounter so	
And let my liver rather heat with wine	
And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.          Exit	
And let them work. The nature of our people,	
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,	
And let young Arthur, Duke of Britaine, in,	
And let your fervour, like my master's, be	
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,	
And life no longer than thy love will stay,	
And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts	
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north	
And little is to do.	
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.	
And look upon, as if the tragedy	
And lusty lads roam here and there,	
And made me climb, With danger of my life.	
And maidens call it Love-in-idleness.	
And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me	
And make assurance here in Padua	
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine	
And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,	
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!	
And make thy weapon drop.	
And make us lose the good we oft might win	
And manacle the berard in their chains,	
And many limits of the charge set down	
And many maiden gardens yet unset,	
And many miles, the Princess bids you tell	
And many other of great name and worth;	
And many such-like liberties of sin;	
And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,	
And marry her at Eton.-Go, send to Falstaff straight.	
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;	
And may direct his course as please himself,	
And may diseases lick up their false bloods!	
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?	
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot	
And meet me presently at Berkeley.	
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;	
And mine a sad one.	
And minister in their steads. To general filths	
And more above, hath his solicitings,	
And my dear father. How features are abroad,	
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,	
And my ending is despair	
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth	
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base	
And my reliances on his fracted dates	
And ne'er a true one.	
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,	
And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,	
And neither way inclines.	
And never be Bassanio so for me;	
And never brandish more revengeful steel	
And never gives to truth and virtue that	
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.	
And none so poor to do him reverence.	
And not for justice? What, shall one of us,	
And not in me! I am myself alone.	
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,	
And not the King exil'd thee; or suppose	
And not to us, but to thy arm alone,	
And not with such a cruel threat'ning look!	
And nothing of a man.	
And now I fear that fatal prophecy.	
And now about the cauldron sing,	
And now he writes to heaven for his redress.	
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,	
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.	
And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy.	
And now to London all the crew are gone	
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought	
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,	
And now, to add more measure to your woes,	
And of a dragon and a finless fish,	
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,	
And on my head did set the diadem.	
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown	
And on the wager lay two earthly women,	
And on this north side win this cape of land;	
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,	
And overlook their grafters?	
And pardon us the interruption	
And parted thus you and your argument.	
And pass them current too. Gods me, my horse!	
And pass'd him unelected.	
And pay no worship to the garish sun.	
And perform an old contracting.                    Exit	
And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;	
And pluck commiseration of his state	
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.	
And pray receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em	
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted	
And proud of many, lives upon his gains?	
And put it to the foil; but you, O you,	
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,	
And ran dismayed away.	
And rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.	
And rear it in the place your father's stands.	
And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,	
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,	
And sails upon the bosom of the air.	
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,	
And save me so much talking.	
And saving those that eye thee!	
And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'	
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:	
And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,	
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,	
And see him seated in the regal throne.               Exeunt	
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass	
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.	
And send him many years of sunshine days!	
And send them thither. But at hand, at hand,	
And set them on Lud's Town.	
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,	
And she is dead; which nothing, but to close	
And she lied buried with her ancestors-	
And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,	
And show me to the shouting varletry	
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.	
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,	
And sing our bondage freely.	
And skilless as unpractis'd infancy.	
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out-	
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention	
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,	
And smooth as monumental alabaster.	
And so I hope he came by't. Back my ring.	
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;	
And so farewell until I meet thee next.                 Exit	
And so good Capulet, which name I tender	
And so let me entreat you leave the house.	
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.	
And so, ere answer knows what question would,	
And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,	
And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.	
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,	
And spare no blood beside.	
And spurn me back; but if it he not so,	
And stand between two churchmen, good my lord;	
And still keep eyes upon her. So good night.	
And strew'd repentant ashes on his head.	
And strokes death to her.	
And such a piece of service will you do,	
And such as to my claim are liable,	
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.	
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.         [Giving a paper]	
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,	
And take his bottle from him. When that's gone	
And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.	
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,	
And taught it thus anew to greet:	
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,	
And tell me, in the modesty of honour,	
And tell thy king I do not seek him now,	
And temper him with all the art I have,	
And ten to one old Joan had not gone out.	
And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,	
And that in way of caution- I must tell you	
And that it was great pity, so it was,	
And that may be determin'd at the one	
And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,	
And that no lawful means can carry me	
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world	
And that the King before the Douglas' rage	
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,	
And that were much he should, for he is given	
And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.	
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we	
And the continuance of their parents' rage,	
And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,	
And the nobility of Rome are his;	
And the premised flames of the last day	
And the remainder that shall still depend	
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.	
And the wolf behowls the moon;	
And then 'twill end.	
And then I ran away to call the watch.	
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.              Exit	
And then I'll bring thee to the present busines	
And then all this thou seest is but a clod	
And then be gone and trouble you no more.	
And then deny her aiding hand therein,	
And then do execution on the watch. Alarum.           Exeunt	
And then end life when I end loyalty!	
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;	
And then imagine me taking your part	
And then to speak.	
And then we will deliver you the cause	
And then will I be general of your woes	
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?	
And there an end; but now they rise again,	
And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,	
And there is such confusion in my powers	
And there receive her approbation;	
And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls	
And there's an oath of credit.	
And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet	
And therefore certainly it were not good	
And therefore frame the law unto my will.	
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.	
And therefore may be broke without offence.	
And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.	
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,	
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself	
And they shall do their office. So be gone.	
And this our life, exempt from public haunt,	
And this same bias, this commodity,	
And this shall all be buried in my death,	
And this weak and idle theme,	
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,	
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance.	
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn	
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.	
And thou that art his mate make boot of this;	
And thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death	
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous	
And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,	
And though you think me poor, I am the man	
And though you took his life, as being our foe,	
And thrust thyself into their companies.	
And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending	
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!	
And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky hard,	
And till I root out their accursed line	
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,	
And to my fortunes and the people's favour	
And to obey shall be in me remorse,	
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,	
And to such men of gravity and learning,	
And to that vineyard is a planched gate	
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind	
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.	
And top of sovereignty?	
And touching now the point of human skill,	
And tread it under foot with all contempt,	
And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.	
And underneath that consecrated roof,	
And victory with little loss doth play	
And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,	
And we are for the dark.	
And we are women's men.	
And we will answer all things faithfully.	
And we will nothing waste till you return.	
And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,	
And weak beginning lie intreasured.	
And wear a golden sorrow.	
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,	
And welcome merry Shrove-tide.	
And well she can persuade.	
And were they but attired in grave weeds,	
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.	
And what I want it boots not to complain.	
And what we do establish he confirms;	
And when I am a-horseback, I will swear	
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,	
And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely	
And when he was not six-and-twenty strong,	
And when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,	
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,	
And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave	
And when thou hast given it to the Emperor,	
And where I did begin, there shall I end;	
And where the worser is predominant,	
And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,	
And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds,	
And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?	
And will acknowledge you and Jessica	
And will not any way dishonour me.	
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,	
And will to France, hoping the consequence	
And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.	
And winking Mary-buds begin	
And with a gad of steel will write these words,	
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,	
And with a sudden re-enforcement struck	
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown	
And with her breath she did perfume the air;	
And with hot irons must I burn them out.	
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground	
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours	
And with submissive loyalty of heart	
And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?	
And with that word she struck me on the head,	
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.	
And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable	
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,	
And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!	
And women too, but innocent and pure;	
And won by rareness such solemnity.	
And wonder what they were, and to what end	
And work confusion on his enemies.	
And worse than Progne I will be reveng'd.	
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:	
And wrap our bodies in black mourning-gowns,	
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,	
And yet a place of high respect with me,	
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.	
And yet the King not privy to my drift,	
And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,	
And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,	
And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!	
And you but one, can every shadow lend:	
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,	
And you must needs bestow her funeral;	
And you shall find his vanities forespent	
And you the calendars of their nativity,	
And you within it. If he fail of that,	
And you, my lords- methinks you do not well	
And young affection gapes to be his heir;	
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,	
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,	
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,	
And, after all this fearful homage done,	
And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give the	
And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds	
And, as you answer, I do know the scope	
And, banding themselves in contrary parts,	
And, being angry, does forget that ever	
And, being credulous in this mad thought,	
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.           Exit WALL	
And, by God's Mother, I, being but a bachelor,	
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.	
And, could it work so much upon your shape	
And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags	
And, ere they be dismiss'd, let them march by.	
And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself	
And, father Cardinal, I have heard you say	
And, fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,	
And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,	
And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee.	
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate	
And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes,	
And, good my lord, so please you let our trains	
And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.	
And, if you prove it, I'll repay it back	
And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,	
And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt	
And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.	
And, in your power, soft silencing your son.	
And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well-	
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.	
And, madam, there is order ta'en for you:	
And, now it is my chance to find thee out,	
And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,	
And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!	
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.	
And, winking, leapt into destruction.	
Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master!	
Anne Bullen! No, I'll no Anne Bullens for him;	
Anne's mind as well as another does. Out upon 't, what	
Another moon; but, O, methinks, how slow	
Another part of the field	
Another part of the island	
Another part of the plain	
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,	
Answer mere nature- bid them flatter thee.	
Ant. Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.	
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.	
Antony yet.	
Any beginning to this peevish odds;	
Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.	
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;	
Appears before them and with solemn march	
Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears,	
Arch. And so there is; but yet the King hath drawn	
Are ceremonious courtiers.	
Are empty trunks, o'erflourish'd by the devil.	
Are gone, are gone;	
Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies	
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,	
Are making hither with all due expedience,	
Are many simples operative, whose power	
Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I	
Are masters to their females, and their lords;	
Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?	
Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters	
Are not the question here.	
Are now become enamour'd on his grave.	
Are now to have no successive degrees,	
Are prized by their masters. Believe't, dear lord,	
Are richly come to harbour suddenly.	
Are safely come to road.	
Are sent to Pomfret, and with them	
Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone?	
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.	
Are well foretold that danger lurks within.	
Are worse than devils.	
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate	
Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.	
Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!	
Arm, wenches, arm! Encounters mounted are	
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.	
Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.	
Art thou of blood and honour?	
Art turn'd the greatest liar.	
Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,	
As Cassius' legions are by Antony.	
As Humphrey, prov'd by reasons, to my liege.	
As I am a true spirit, welcome!           [A noise of horns]	
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it	
As I can of those mysteries which heaven	
As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,	
As I foretold you, were all spirits, and	
As I had title in thy noble husband!	
As I have given out him. My sons, I must	
As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.	
As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch	
As I intended, for it wrought on her	
As I might love. I never gave him token.	
As I wish you were.	
As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,	
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?	
As Lewis himself. So, nobles, shall you all,	
As a false favourite doth his prince's name,	
As able to perform't, his mind and place	
As ample as myself.	
As are companions noted and most known	
As are our wretches fett'red in our prisons;	
As are the swelling Adriatic seas.	
As being well content with that alone.	
As by your Grace shall be propounded him	
As captain shall. Simply the thing I am	
As closely to conceal what we impart.	
As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!	
As curst, as harsh, and horrible to hear,	
As day does to your eye.	
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.	
As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,	
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.	
As enemy to the people and his country.	
As far as land will let me by your side.	
As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop	
As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,	
As for her Greeks and Troyans suff'red death.	
As frankly as a pin.	
As great in admiration as herself,	
As haggards of the rock.	
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.	
As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.	
As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;	
As he is fam'd for mildness, peace, and prayer.	
As he made semblance of his duty, would	
As he whose brow with homely biggen bound	
As he will have me, how am I so poor?	
As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid	
As honest as I am.	
As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,	
As humorous as winter, and as sudden	
As if she had suborned some to swear	
As if the world were all dissolv'd to tears,	
As if those organs had deceptious functions	
As if thou ne'er walk'st further than Finsbury.	
As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,	
As is the night before some festival	
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk	
As it is won with blood, lost be it so!	
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.	
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;	
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;	
As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,	
As like enough it will- I'ld have it copied.	
As likely to be blest in peace and war;	
As looks the mother on her lowly babe	
As love between them like the palm might flourish,	
As matter whole you have not to make it with,	
As motion and long-during action tires	
As much as one sound cudgel of four foot-	
As much as would maintain, to the King's honour,	
As much in mock as mark.	
As my true service shall deserve your love.	
As now we meet. You have deceiv'd our trust	
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear	
As precious eyesight, and did value me	
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.	
As rous'd with rage, with rage doth sympathise,	
As shore of rock. Attend: this holy fox,	
As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt	
As sure a card as ever won the set;	
As testy sick men when their deaths be near,	
As they themselves would owe them.	
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make	
As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.	
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time	
As thou art knight, never to disobey	
As thou hast done with me- What, Jessica!-	
As thou my sometime daughter.	
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.	
As thus: 'Come, little ones'; and then again,	
As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,	
As to be cast forth in the common air,	
As very infants prattle of thy pride.	
As war were hoodwink'd.	
As we are now glad to behold your eyes-	
As we do air, fast as 'twas minist'red,	
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.	
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate	
As well assur'd Richard their King is dead.             Exit	
As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,	
As well to see the vessel that's come in	
As when the golden sun salutes the morn,	
As where's that palace whereinto foul things	
As worthy cause I have to fear I am-	
As yet not come to life, who in their seeds	
As you have been- that's for my country.	
As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,	
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.	
As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands,	
As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives.	
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day.	
At a fair vestal, throned by the west,	
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are	
At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,	
At many leisures I propos'd.	
At one fell swoop?	
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;	
At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream,	
At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,	
At the prefixed hour of her waking	
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.	
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,	
At which appear'd against him his surveyor,	
At your best leisure, this his humble suit.	
Atalanta's better part,	
Athens. ANTONY'S house	
Attend him here this morning.	
Attend the sequel of your imposition,	
Attendants	
Attendants on Theseus and Hippolyta	
Attendants with foils and gauntlets.	
Augustus lives to think on't; and so much	
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,	
Awake, awake!	
Away from light steals home my heavy son	
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!	
Away!	
Away, go, away!                                       Exeunt	
Away, my masters! trouble us no more;	
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.	
Ay, and since too, murthers have been perform'd	
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear	
Ay, there, look grim as hell!	
Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose	
Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be brib'd

BANQUO. As far, my lord, as will fill up the time	
BANQUO. Look, how our partner's rapt.	
BANQUO. Thanks, sir, the like to you.	
BANQUO. [Aside to Macbeth.] That, trusted home,	
BAPTISTA MINOLA, a gentleman of Padua	
BAPTISTA. A mighty man of Pisa. By report	
BAPTISTA. Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,	
BAPTISTA. But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.	
BAPTISTA. I must confess your offer is the best;	
BAPTISTA. I'll after him and see the event of this.	
BAPTISTA. Lucentio is your name? Of whence, I pray?	
BAPTISTA. Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.	
BAPTISTA. Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?	
BAPTISTA. Why, that's all one.	
BARDOLPH. Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!	
BARDOLPH. By this sword, he that makes the first thrust I'll kill	
BARDOLPH. Hold, Wart. Traverse- thus, thus, thus.	
BARDOLPH. In bodily health, sir.	
BARDOLPH. Pray thee go down, good ancient.	
BARDOLPH. Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than with a	
BARDOLPH. The army is discharged all and gone.	
BARDOLPH. Yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.	
BARDOLPH. You Banbury cheese!	
BARNARDINE, a dissolute prisoner	
BARNARDINE. Not a word; if you have anything to say to me, come to	
BARNARDINE. [ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.	
BASSANIO. And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?	
BASSANIO. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.	
BASSANIO. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!	
BASSANIO. So may the outward shows be least themselves;	
BASSANIO. The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,	
BASSIANUS. Lavinia, how say you?	
BASSIANUS. Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.	
BASTARD.  [Aside]  O prudent discipline! From north to south,	
BASTARD. Bastards and else.	
BASTARD. Ha, majesty! how high thy glory tow'rs	
BASTARD. He will the rather do it when he sees	
BASTARD. How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging wood,	
BASTARD. I Will seek them out.	
BASTARD. I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.	
BASTARD. I, madam? No, I have no reason for it-	
BASTARD. Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;	
BASTARD. Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!	
BASTARD. O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar!	
BASTARD. See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;	
BASTARD. Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:	
BATES. Be friends, you English fools, be friends; we have	
BATES. He hath not told his thought to the King?	
BEDFORD. O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!	
BELARIUS. Be pleas'd awhile.	
BELARIUS. I had no mind	
BELARIUS. Is not this boy reviv'd from death?	
BELARIUS. Let us from it.	
BELARIUS. O melancholy!	
BELARIUS. Peace, peace! see further. He eyes us not; forbear.	
BELARIUS. [Looking into the cave] Stay, come not in.	
BEROWNE. A dangerous law against gentility.	
BEROWNE. A death's face in a ring.	
BEROWNE. Because thou hast no face.	
BEROWNE. Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;	
BEROWNE. I post from love; good lover, let me go.	
BEROWNE. I would you heard it groan.	
BEROWNE. It must be done this afternoon.	
BEROWNE. No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you;	
BEROWNE. Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.	
BEROWNE. Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!	
BEROWNE. This cannot be Hector.	
BEROWNE. This, fellow. What wouldst?	
BEROWNE. To move wild laughter in the throat of death?	
BEROWNE. What is a remuneration?	
BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down	
BERTRAM. Do you think I am so far deceived in him?	
BERTRAM. Hers it was not.	
BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your	
BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.	
BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord.	
BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?	
BERTRAM. Where are my other men, monsieur?	
BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and common speech

BIANCA. What, master, read you, First resolve me that.	
BIANCA. Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong	
BIONDELLO. He that has the two fair daughters; is't he you mean?	
BIONDELLO. I have seen them in the church together. God send 'em	
BIONDELLO. Nay, by Saint Jamy,	
BIONDELLO. Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?	
BLANCH. My uncle's will in this respect is mine.	
BLANCH. O, well did he become that lion's robe	
BLUNT. Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it;	
BOLINGBROKE. As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;	
BOLINGBROKE. Many years of happy days befall	
BOLINGBROKE. Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make	
BOLINGBROKE. We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;	
BOLINGBROKE. Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.	
BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, sir.	
BOTH.      Quiet consummation have,	
BOTH. Beseech your honour	
BOTTOM, a weaver	
BOTTOM. A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out	
BOTTOM. An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too.	
BOTTOM. Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen

BOY. At your own house; there he unarms him.	
BOYET.    An I cannot, cannot, cannot,	
BOYET. A light for Monsieur Judas! It grows dark, he may stumble.	
BOYET. A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.	
BOYET. Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty	
BOYET. Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud:	
BOYET. I am much deceived but I remember the style.	
BOYET. I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.	
BOYET. Proud of employment, willingly I go.	
BOYET. She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.	
BOYET. Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.	
BOYET. This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;

BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward	
BRUTUS. But is this true, sir?	
BRUTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.	
BRUTUS. Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber	
BRUTUS. Do so, and let no man abide this deed	
BRUTUS. Farewell, everyone.	
BRUTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.	
BRUTUS. Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!	
BRUTUS. Good night, good brother.	
BRUTUS. He is welcome hither.	
BRUTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part	
BRUTUS. I know that we shall have him well to friend.	
BRUTUS. I would he had.	
BRUTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.	
BRUTUS. In that there's comfort.	
BRUTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,	
BRUTUS. It was his word. O, he would miss it rather	
BRUTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.	
BRUTUS. Let them go on;	
BRUTUS. My countrymen-	
BRUTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself	
BRUTUS. Not to them all.	
BRUTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,	
BRUTUS. Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.	
BRUTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills	
BRUTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,	
BRUTUS. The aediles, ho!	
BRUTUS. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar	
BRUTUS. They are all welcome.	
BRUTUS. They have ta'en note of us; keep on your way.	
BRUTUS. We stay here for the people.	
BRUTUS. What said Popilius Lena?	
BRUTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?	
BRUTUS. What, Lucius, ho!	
BRUTUS. Why comest thou?	
BRUTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.	
BRUTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!	
BUCKINGHAM. Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!	
BUCKINGHAM. All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.	
BUCKINGHAM. Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee.	
BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!	
BUCKINGHAM. Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,	
BUCKINGHAM. I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind	
BUCKINGHAM. I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there;	
BUCKINGHAM. Lo you, my lord,	
BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,	
BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom-	
BUCKINGHAM. Sir,	
BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;	
BUCKINGHAM. Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.	
BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?	
BUCKINGHAM. Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.	
BUCKINGHAM. York, if thou meanest well I greet thee well.	
BULLCALF. O Lord! good my lord captain-	
BURGUNDY. As love is, my lord, before it loves.	
BURGUNDY. Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.	
BUSHY. Well, we may meet again.	
BUTTS.  [Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am glad	
Back to our brother of England.	
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,	
Bal. Romeo.	
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,	
Balthasar, attendant on Don Pedro.	
Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,	
Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have	
Bard. Indeed, Sir John, you said so.	
Bardolph.	
Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold;	
Be all my sins rememb'red.	
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;	
Be by my friends in Spain advis'd, whose counsel	
Be call'd your vanquisher.	
Be counterpois'd with such a petty sum!	
Be done in this and all things! I obey.	
Be fear'd of doing harm. Make your own purpose,	
Be gone!	
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors.	
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio	
Be humble to us, call my sovereignvours	
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost	
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?	
Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.	
Be perfect.	
Be resident in men like one another,	
Be soon collected, and all things thought upon	
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;	
Be this sweet Helen's knell. And now forget her.	
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood	
Beat loud the tambourines, let the trumpets blow,	
Beat. For them all together, which maintain'd so politic a state of	
Beat. I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to

Beauty and honour in her are so mingled	
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!	
Because I would not dull you with my song.	
Because all those things you have done of late,	
Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd.	
Because you are not merry; and 'twere as easy	
Because your speech hath none that tells him so?	
Becomes not Rome; nor has Coriolanus	
Been struck so to the soul that presently	
Before Gloucester's Castle; Kent in the stocks.	
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts	
Before PROSPERO'S cell	
Before York	
Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!	
Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet	
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend	
Before the walls of Athens	
Before you find it other. All the regions	
Before you open it.	
Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow'rs	
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,	
Began to scold and raise up such a storm	
Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,	
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;	
Behind the arras hearing something stir,	
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!	
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.	
Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;	
Behold, as may unworthiness define,	
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea-	
Being all to dolours turn'd?	
Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth,	
Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.	
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint	
Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd	
Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.	
Being mounted and both roused in their seats,	
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,	
Being sick, have in some measure made me well;	
Being so troublesome a bedfellow?	
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?	
Believe't not lightly- though I go alone,	
Belike some noble gentleman that means,	
Bells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,	
Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene	
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!	
Below the beam of sight; yet will I still	
Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's	
Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?	
Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being	
Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!	
Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!	
Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;	
Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?	
Bend their best studies, heartily request	
Bene. Come, bid me do anything for thee.	
Bene. Gallants, I am not as I have been.	
Bene. Good day, my lord.	
Bene. Hear me, Beatrice!	
Bene. Think not on him till to-morrow. I'll devise thee brave	
Bene. This can be no trick. The conference was sadly borne; they	
Bene. We'll be friends first.	
Bene. What offence, sweet Beatrice?	
Bene. Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise,	
Bene. You hear, Count Claudio. I can be secret as a dumb man, I

Benedick.	
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy	
Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.	
Ber. It would be spoke to.	
Beseeching Thee, if with Thy will it stands	
Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!	
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,	
Besides, Antonio certified the Duke	
Better it is to die, better to starve,	
Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry	
Between the King and Katharine?	
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.	
Beyond all man's endeavours. My endeavours,	
Bid him repair to me, and bring with him	
Bid me do anything but that, sweet Greek.	
Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not	
Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.	
Bless her when she is riggish.	
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,	
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.	
Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!	
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?	
Blunt. And God defend but still I should stand so,	
Blunt. Shall I return this answer to the King?	
Blush that the world goes well; who rather had,	
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.	
Bora. Didst thou not hear somebody?	
Bora. Even he.	
Bora. No, by my soul, she was not;	
Bora. Not so neither. But know that I have to-night wooed Margaret,	
Bora. Sweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer. Do you	
Bora. That shows thou art unconfirm'd. Thou knowest that the	
Bora. Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But seest thou	
Bora. We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken up of	
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,	
Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind,	
Both have I spill'd. O, would the deed were good!	
Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,	
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,	
Both what by sea and land I can be able	
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,	
Both. My lord, from head to foot.	
Boy, let me see the writing.	
Boy. Signior?	
Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.	
Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such	
Brainford?	
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain	
Breaking his oath and resolution like	
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.	
Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art thou alive,	
Breed him some prejudice; for from this league	
Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,	
Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage;	
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;	
Bring thou the master to the citadel;	
Bring us to this sight, and you shall say	
Britain. A field of battle between the British and Roman camps	
Britain. CYMBELINE'S tent	
Brook-I suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first,	
Brought my too diligent ear; for several virtues	
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;	
Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a father	
Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.	
Bury him where you can, he comes not here.	
But Barnardine must die this afternoon;	
But I am doubtful of your modesties,	
But I can tell you that of late this Duke	
But I do prophesy th' election lights	
But I had rather kill two enemies.	
But I protest he had the chain of me,	
But I will beard him.	
But I will tell you at some meeter season.	
But I will watch you from such watching now.	
But I, who never knew how to entreat,	
But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.	
But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,	
But Romeo may not- he is banished.	
But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought	
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,	
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun	
But altogether lacks the abilities	
But an unkind self, that itself will leave	
But answer made it none. Yet once methought	
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,	
But being awak'd, I do despise my dream.	
But buckler with thee blows, twice two for one.	
But by bad courses may be understood	
But by degree, stand in authentic place?	
But by example- O, a sin in war	
But by particular consent proceeded	
But can do more in England than the King.	
But certainly a maid.	
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.	
But come what may, I do adore thee so	
But come, young waverer, come go with me.	
But conquer'd merely.	
But could be willing to march on to Calais	
But day by night and night by day oppressed.	
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,	
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.	
But death doth front thee with apparent spoil	
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.	
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment	
But do not so, I love thee in such sort,	
But even with law against the wilful sons	
But every puny whipster gets my sword.	
But fetter you till death.	
But first I will release the Fairy Queen.	
But for his own; and for the right of that	
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,	
But for the handkerchief-	
But for the rest: you tell a pedigree	
But for their virtue only is their show,	
But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them-	
But for you, rebels- look to taste the due	
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,	
But get thee gone; I shall be there before thee.	
But great men tremble when the lion roars,	
But he already is too insolent;	
But he shall know I am as good	
But here's a villain that would face me down	
But his performance, as he is now, nothing.	
But how he died God knows, not Henry.	
But how is it that great Plantagenet	
But if I live, his feigned ecstasies	
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:	
But if thy love were ever like to mine,	
But if your father had been victor there,	
But if't be he I mean, he's very wild	
But instruments of some more mightier member	
But it reserv'd some quantity of choice	
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,	
But let our plot go forward. Let our wives	
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?	
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,	
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;	
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.	
But meeting with Salerio by the way,	
But more devout than this in our respects	
But my five wits, nor my five senses can	
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.	
But never till tonight, never till now,	
But no such roses see I in her cheeks,	
But not another sin upon my head	
But not rememb'red in thy epitaph!	
But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.	
But now I am past all comforts here, but prayers.	
But once a day, it would unclog my heart	
But only she; and she deserves a lord	
But only slaught'red by the ireful arm	
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.	
But penetrable to your kind entreaties,	
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.	
But prove a chief offender in the same?	
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.	
But rising at thy name doth point out thee,	
But sad mortality o'ersways their power,	
But sanctuary children never till now.	
But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen.	
But shall be render'd to your public laws	
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;	
But she, more covetous, would have a chain.	
But since correction lieth in those hands	
But since it would not, he had none of me.	
But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,	
But since you make your pleasure of your pains,	
But since your ladyship is not at leisure,	
But soft, but see, or rather do not see,	
But speak, Egeus; is not this the day	
But stand against us like an enemy.	
But stay the very riping of the time;	
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,	
But stay, I'll read it over once again.	
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;	
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.	
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know	
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;	
But sup them well, and look unto them all;	
But tell me whom thou seek'st.	
But that I am your most obedient servant.	
But that I was a journeyman to grief?	
But that it eats our victuals, I should think	
But that myself should be the root and father	
But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame,	
But that the dread of something after death-	
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,	
But that, till further trial in those charges	
But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir,	
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,	
But there is come a messenger before,	
But there's but one in all doth hold his place.	
But they must blab-	
But thou didst understand me by my signs,	
But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,	
But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep.	
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers;	
But tickles still the sore.	
But to recover of us, by strong hand	
But to support him after. Fare you well.	
But to the matter that we have in hand:	
But to torment you with my bitter tongue!	
But toiling desperately to find it out-	
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true

But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,	
But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.	
But what is your affair in Elsinore?	
But what serve for thunder? Precious villain!	
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base	
But what will you be call'd?	
But whe'er I be as true begot or no,	
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,	
But when he frown'd, it was against the French	
But when my angry guardant stood alone,

But where's the body that I should embrace?	
But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,

But who comes here? I am invisible;	
But winter and rough weather.	
But with proviso and exception,	
But yet I call you servile ministers,	
But yet I cannot help you.	
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?	
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart	
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.	
But you must join in souls to mock me too?	
But you shall do no harm.	
But you, that are polluted with your lusts,	
But your discretions better can persuade

But, teLL me is young George Stanley living.	
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,	
But. Tut! I came not to hear this.	
By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;	
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.	
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie	
By all the laws of war y'are privileg'd.

By bare imagination of a feast?	
By being in his eye. Most gracious Duke,	
By calmness or by absence; all's in anger.	
By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn,	
By dark'ning my clear sun. My lord, farewell.	
By doing damned hate upon thyself?	
By duty ruminated.	
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.	
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart	
By heaven, I love thee better than myself,	
By him and by this woman here what know you?

By marrying her which I must reach unto.	
By me invested, he compeers the best.	
By night frequents my house. I am a man

By this device.	
By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his

CAESAR'S camp	
CAESAR, the other way. After their going in is heard

CAESAR. The gods do this in shame of cowardice.	
CAESAR. The power of Caesar, and	
CAESAR. There's the point.	
CAESAR. What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.	
CAIUS. Clapper-de-claw! Vat is dat?	
CAIUS. Ha, do I perceive dat? Have you make-a de sot of us,

CASCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow	
CASCA. No.	
CASCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.	
CASCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,

CASSANDRA. Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,	
CASSIO.                  Yet, I beseech you,	
CASSIO. 'Tis truly so.	
CASSIO. I do not understand.	
CASSIO. I know not, sweet. I found it in my chamber.	
CASSIO. Masters, play here, I will content your pains; Something

CATESBY. Many good morrows to my noble lord!	
CATESBY. My lord,	
CELIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.	
CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;	
CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out	
CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.	
CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her	
CELIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;	
CELIA. Thou hast not, cousin.	
CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.	
CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too

CHAMBERLAIN. My lords, you speak your pleasures.	
CHAMBERLAIN. True, they are so;	
CHAMBERLAIN. Well said, my lord.	
CHARLES. And, for myself, most part of all this night,	
CHARLES. Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!	
CHARLES. Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed	
CHARLES. Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms.	
CHARLES. What she says I'll confirm; we'll fight it out.

CHARMIAN. Then belike my children shall have no names.	
CHARMIAN. Three in Egypt	
CHARMIAN. Wrinkles forbid!	
CHIEF JUSTICE. I am assur'd, if I be measur'd rightly,	
CHIEF JUSTICE. I then did use the person of your father;	
CHIEF JUSTICE. Now, Master Gower, what news?	
CHIEF JUSTICE. What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir	
CHIRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air	
CHIRON. I blush to think upon this ignomy.

CITIZEN. Till you compound whose right is worthiest,	
CITIZENS. Now the gods keep you!	
CLARENCE. A little fire is quickly trodden out,

CLEOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth	
CLEOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!	
CLEOPATRA. Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?	
CLEOPATRA. Dolabella!	
CLEOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!	
CLEOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.	
CLEOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee	
CLEOPATRA. Pray you tell him	
CLEOPATRA. Remember'st thou any that have died on't?	
CLEOPATRA. Saw you my lord?	
CLEOPATRA. See, Caesar! O, behold,	
CLEOPATRA. So it should be, that none but Antony

CLEOPATRA. Th'art an honest man.	
CLEOPATRA. Was he not here?	
CLEOPATRA. What have I kept back?

CLIFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,	
CLIFFORD. How now, is he dead already? Or is it fear	
CLIFFORD. No cause!	
CLIFFORD. Patience is for poltroons such as he;	
CLIFFORD. Whom should he follow but his natural king?	
CLITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,	
CLITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?	
CLOTEN. 'His garments'! Now the devil-	
CLOTEN. Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation	
CLOTEN. There is gold for you; sell me your good report.	
CLOTEN. We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan.

CLOWN. Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.	
CLOWN. Dexteriously, good madonna.	
CLOWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find	
CLOWN. Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest	
CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit	
CLOWN. Good Sir Toby!	
CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in	
CLOWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,	
CLOWN. I must catechize you for it, madonna.	
CLOWN. I would, therefore, my sister had had name, sir.	
CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades'	
CLOWN. Like a drown'd man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above	
CLOWN. Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go,	
CLOWN. Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.	
CLOWN. No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.	
CLOWN. No, sir, the worse.

CONSTANCE, Mother to Arthur	
CONSTANCE.  [Rising]  A wicked day, and not a holy day!	
CONSTANCE. My bed was ever to thy son as true	
CONSTANCE. What should he say, but as the Cardinal?	
CONSTANCE. Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?	
CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at

CORIOLANUS. Come, leave your tears; a brief farewell. The beast	
CORIOLANUS. First, hear me speak.	
CORIOLANUS. I do owe them still	
CORIOLANUS. I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun	
CORIOLANUS. I'll give my reasons,	
CORIOLANUS. My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done	
CORIOLANUS. No, take more.	
CORIOLANUS. Pray be content.	
CORIOLANUS. Scratches with briers,	
CORIOLANUS. That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,	
CORIOLANUS. To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!'	
CORIOLANUS. Under the canopy.	
CORIOLANUS. What makes this change?	
COSTARD. From my Lord Berowne, a good master of mine,	
COSTARD. From my lord to my lady.	
COSTARD. I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the	
COSTARD. I was taken with none, sir; I was taken with a damsel.	
COSTARD. It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great;	
COSTARD. Me?	
COSTARD. Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.	
COSTARD. Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for	
COSTARD. She's too hard for you at pricks, sir; challenge her to	
COSTARD. Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.	
COSTARD. The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.	
COSTARD. This maid will serve my turn, sir.	
COSTARD. Which is the greatest lady, the highest?	
COSTARD. Your servant, and Costard.	
COUNTESS. Brought you this letter, gentlemen?	
COUNTESS. But think you, Helen,	
COUNTESS. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare	
COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his	
COUNTESS. I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;	
COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.	
COUNTESS. The plot is laid; if all things fall out right,	
COUNTESS. To me, blood-thirsty lord

COUNTESS. YOU have discharg'd this honestly; keep it to yourself.	
COURTEZAN. Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.	
CRANMER. For me?	
CRANMER. My good lords, hitherto in all the progress	
CRESSIDA. A woeful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!	
CRESSIDA. Are you aweary of me?	
CRESSIDA. Ay, a minc'd man; and then to be bak'd with no date in	
CRESSIDA. Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart.	
CRESSIDA. By the same token, you are a bawd.	
CRESSIDA. Guardian! Why, Greek!	
CRESSIDA. Hector was gone; but Helen was not up.	
CRESSIDA. I am your debtor; claim it when 'tis due.	
CRESSIDA. I must then to the Grecians?	
CRESSIDA. In kissing, do you render or receive?	
CRESSIDA. Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the	
CRESSIDA. Nay, but you part in anger.	
CRESSIDA. O Jupiter! there's no comparison.	
CRESSIDA. Prithee tarry.	
CRESSIDA. To say the truth, true and not true.	
CRESSIDA. What sneaking fellow comes yonder?	
CRESSIDA. Why tell you me of moderation?	
CRESSIDA. With millstones.	
CRESSIDA. You may.	
CRESSIDA. You shall not go. One cannot speak a word	
CURTIS. Here.	
CURTIS. How?	
CURTIS. I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?	
CURTIS. Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?	
CURTIS. There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news?	
CURTIS. Who is that calls so coldly?	
CYMBELINE. I am sorry for thee.	
CYMBELINE. Marry, the gods forfend!	
CYMBELINE. My lords, you are appointed for that office;	
CYMBELINE. That diamond upon your finger, say	
CYMBELINE. This hath some seeming.	
CYMBELINE. What's this, Cornelius?	
Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!	
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,	
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipt.	
Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,	
Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find anybody in the	
Calchas' tent; I'll keep you company.	
Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,	
Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought	
Call him to present trial. If he may	
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!	
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!	
Came crying 'mongst his foes,	
Came in and satisfied him.	
Came not till now to dignify the times,	
Came then into my mind, and yet my mind	
Came there a certain lord, neat and trimly dress'd,	
Came there for cure and this by that I prove,	
Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,	
Can change their moons and bring their times about,	
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head	
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,	
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,	
Cannot be bordered certain in itself.	
Cannot contain their urine; for affection,

Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.	
Cap. Go, begone.	
Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,	
Cap. How canst thou try them so?	
Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?	
Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?	
Captain General of the Grecian army, et cetera, Agamemnon. Do	
Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me	
Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big	
Carrier. As fat as butter.	
Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,	
Cesario, by the roses of the spring,	
Chain mine arm'd neck. Leap thou, attire and all,	
Change shapes with Protheus for advantages,	
Changes the mood; for what in me was purchas'd	
Cheshu, I think 'a will plow up all, if there is not better	
Chief factors for the gods: I do not know	
Child of integrity, hath from my soul	
Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius	
Churchmen so hot? Good uncle, hide such malice;	
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest;	
Claud. God bless me from a challenge!	
Claud. Good day to both of you.	
Claud. Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die	
Claud. I know not how to pray your patience;	
Claud. I think he thinks upon the savage bull.	
Claud. In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for the	
Claud. Is she not a modest young lady?	
Claud. No.	
Claud. O mischief strangely thwarting!	
Claud. O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily do, not	
Claud. Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:	
Claud. To the tuition of God. From my house--if I had it--	
Claud. Whither?	
Claud. Why then, she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.	
Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.	
Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy	
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.	
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.	
Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe'er,	
Come away, come away, death;	
Come hither from the furrow, and be merry;	
Come hither, come hither, come hither.	
Come hither, sir.	
Come lead me, officers, to the block of shame;	
Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;	
Come therefore, let's about it speedily.              Exeunt	
Come thou on my side and entreat for me-	
Come unto these yellow sands,	
Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender; in.	
Come, bring me where they are.                       Exeunt.	
Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.        Exeunt.	
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is;	
Come, go we to the King; our power is ready,	
Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest;	
Come, hang them on this line.	
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.	
Come, let me see what task I have to do.	
Come, let us four to dinner. I dare say	
Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,	
Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:	
Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed	
Come, mourn with me for what I do lament,	
Come, shall we go?	
Come, side by side together live and die;	
Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;	
Come.                                                 Exeunt	
Comes armed through our watch, so like the King	
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?	
Commanded me to follow and attend	
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul,	
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.	
Common soldiers pass	
Compare dead happiness with living woe;	
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,

Con. Off, coxcomb!	
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down,	
Confesses that she secretly o'erheard	
Confound your hidden falsehood and award	
Consent upon the order of their fight,	
Consider of it.'	
Consider then, we come but in despite.	
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,	
Constring'd in mass by the almighty sun,	
Consuming it with speaking!	
Contemn with mows the other; nor i' th' judgment,	
Convenient numbers to make good the city;

Curbing his lavish spirit; and, to conclude,	
Curs'd be I that did so! All the charms	
Cut thread and thrum;

For on that ground I'll make a holy descant;	
For out o' doors he went without their help	
For parting us- O, is all forgot?	
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,

For she is chang'd, as she had never been.	
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,	
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,	
For so appears this fleet majestical,	
For so they seem. Th' have left their barge and landed,	
For some dishonest manners of their life,	
For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend	
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,	
For stony limits cannot hold love out,	
For such proceeding I am charged withal-	
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him	
For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy	
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,	
For term of life thou art assured mine,	
For that my grandsire was an Englishman-	
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd	
For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid.	
For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,	
For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,	
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,	
For the most gentle Claudio.	
For the sea's worth. But, look! What lights come yond?	
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp	
For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,	
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,	
For then both parties nobly are subdu'd,	
For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.	
For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)	
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,	
For there will be a world of water shed	
For they in thee a thousand errors note,	
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded-	
For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,	
For this advertisement is five days old.	
For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste	
For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman,	
For this the foolish over-careful fathers	
For this they have engrossed and pil'd up	
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.	
For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,	
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine	
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,	
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.	
For we do fear the law? What company	
For we will hear, note, and believe in heart,	
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Britaine,	
For well I know he was unnatural.	
For what before it was.	
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?

For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly	
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,

For whilst I think I am thy married wife	
For who love I so much? And now who knows	
For whom he now is banish'd- her own price	
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,	
For wise men say it is the wisest course.	
For women's fear and love holds quantity,	
For wooing here until I sweat again,	
For you have but mistook me all this while.	
For you shall hence upon your wedding day.	
For you shall read that my great-grandfather	
For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.

For, by my fathers' reverend tomb, I vow	
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,

For, seeing him, I see my life in death.	
For. Go softly on.

From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.	
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!

From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.

From my own windows torn my household coat,	
From off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodies

From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet	
From the murtherer's gibbet throw	
From the report that goes upon your goodness;	
From this unhallow'd and blood-stained hole?	
From treason's secret knife and traitor's rage	
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;	
From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest	
From whence you have them. You are jealous now	
From where you do remain let paper show.	
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,	
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love	
Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed.

GOBBO. Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-	
GOBBO. Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to	
GONZALO, an honest old counsellor	
GONZALO. All three of them are desperate; their great guilt,	
GONZALO. But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost	
GONZALO. I have inly wept,	
GONZALO. No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my	
GONZALO. Well, I have done; but yet-	
GONZALO. What's the matter?	
GOWER. 'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the cowardly	
GOWER. Enough, Captain, you have astonish'd him.	
GRATIANO,     "    "    "     "     "	
GRATIANO.                                    Fie!	
GRATIANO. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself;	
GRATIANO. Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,	
GRATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways	
GREEN. My comfort is that heaven will take our souls,	
GREMIO	
GREMIO. A husband? a devil.	
GREMIO. But so is not she.	
GREMIO. Hark you, sir, you mean not her to-	
GREMIO. I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this	
GREMIO. O this learning, what a thing it is!	
GREMIO. What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!	
GREY, as Queen; PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS,	
GRIFFITH, gentleman-usher to Queen Katharine	
GRIFFITH. How does your Grace?	
GRUMIO. Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long	
GRUMIO. Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find	
GRUMIO. Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the	
GRUMIO. I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.	
GRUMIO. Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I	
GRUMIO. Lend thine ear.	
GRUMIO. Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,	
GRUMIO. Why, 'Jack boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou wilt.	
GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS, sons to Cymbeline, disguised under the	
GUIDERIUS. Hence, then, and thank	
GUIDERIUS. I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,	
GUIDERIUS. I am thoroughly weary.	
GUIDERIUS. Than be so,	
GUIDERIUS. This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;	
GUIDERIUS. Uncertain favour!	
GUIDERIUS. We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.	
Gads. Give me thy hand. Thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as	
Gads. I prithee lend me this lantern to see my gelding in the	
Gads. Some eight or ten.	
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!	
Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;	
Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck'd guests,	
Gave it a judge's clerk! No, God's my judge,	
Gave wings to my propension, and cut of	
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?	
Gent. 'Tis so; they are afoot.	
Gent. A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,	
Gent. Made you no more offence but what you speak of?	
Gent. Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that	
Gent. No, since.	
Gent. You shall have anything.	
Gentle lover, remedy.	
Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow	
Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.	
Gilded tombs do worms infold.	
Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will	
Give life to yours.	
Give me some help.	
Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead	
Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,	
Give me this maid your daughter?	
Give so much light that I may read by them.	
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me	
Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.	
Give you good night.                                   Exit.	
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence	
Gives her fame which never dies.	
Gives him a letter.	
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.	
Glend. A shorter time shall send me to you, lords;	
Glend. The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.	
Glend. Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil.	
Glou. Ay, my good lord.	
Glou. But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than	
Glou. By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done	
Glou. Here, take this Purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues	
Glou. My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable	
Glou. No words, no words! hush.	
Glou. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to	
Glou. With all my heart.	
Glou. You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;	
Gloucestershire; and, when you come to court, stand my good lord,	
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.      Exit PROVOST	
Go home with it, and please your wife withal;	
Go on and fetch our horses back again.	
Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.        Exeunt	
Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business.	
Go with me, Silvius.                                  Exeunt	
Go, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.                Exeunt	
Go, gentlemen,                                Exit LAUNCELOT	
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,	
Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go;	
Goblin, lead them up and down.	
God and our good cause fight upon our side;	
God knows I will not do it to the death.	
God pless you, Aunchient Pistol! you scurvy, lousy knave, God	
God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?	
God speed the parliament! Who shall be the Speaker?	
God witness with me, when I here came in	
God's light, with two points on your shoulder? Much!	
Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect	
Gods, put the strength o' th' Leonati in me!	
Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?	
Gold cannot come amiss were she a devil.	
Gon. Combine together 'gainst the enemy;	
Gon. Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,	
Gon. Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.	
Gonzago'?	
Good Duke, receive thy daughter;	
Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!	
Good boy, wink at me, and say thou saw'st me not. Fare thee well.	
Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!	
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,	
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,	
Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.	
Good night and good repose.	
Good night.	
Good signior, you shall more command with years	
Good sir, go with us.	
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?	
Good-morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past;	
Goodman, my Lord Cardinal's man, for keeping my house and lands,	
Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,	
Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship!	
Grace hath made the match, and all grace say Amen to it!	
Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss	
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy	
Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well;	
Graves only be men's works and death their gain!	
Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,	
Greg. How? turn thy back and run?	
Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.	
Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,	
Growing a bath and healthful remedy,	
Guard her till Caesar come.                             Exit	
Guil. Faith, her privates we.	
Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.	
Guil. My lord, we were sent for.	
Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard	
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,	
HASTINGS.  [Within]  What is't o'clock?	
HASTINGS. I know they do, and I have well deserv'd it.	
HASTINGS. I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;	
HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours,	
HASTINGS. O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out	
HASTINGS. So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!	
HASTINGS. The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;	
HECTOR. Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.	
HELEN. And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.	
HELEN. Nay, but, my lord-	
HELENA. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.	
HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;	
HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.	
HELENA. How do you mean?	
HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd.	
HELENA. Is this the way?	
HELENA. No, my good lord;	
HELENA. Nor would I wish you.	
HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,	
HELENA. O weary night, O long and tedious night,	
HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.	
HELENA. Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.	
HELENA. Tax of impudence,	
HELENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;	
HELENA. What two things?	
HELENA. What's his name?	
HELENA. You see it lawful then. It is no more	
HELENA. Your virtue is my privilege for that:	
HELENUS	
HENRY PERCY, surnamed HOTSPUR, his son	
HENRY, EARL OF RICHMOND, afterwards KING HENRY VII	
HERMIA. And in the wood where often you and I	
HERMIA. His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.	
HERMIA. O me! you juggler! you cankerblossom!	
HERMIA. So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,	
HERMIA. The more I hate, the more he follows me.	
HERMIA. What! Can you do me greater harm than hate?	
HERMIA. With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!	
HIPPOLYTA. I am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!	
HIPPOLYTA. Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a	
HOLOFERNES. I will repeat them: a, e, I-	
HOLOFERNES. Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation,	
HOLOFERNES. Or mons, the hill.	
HOLOFERNES. What is the figure? What is the figure?	
HORTENSIO	
HORTENSIO. From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!	
HORTENSIO. I do assure thee, father, so it is.	
HORTENSIO. Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.	
HORTENSIO. Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,	
HORTENSIO. SO Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray. Though	
HORTENSIO. Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!	
HORTENSIUS. Most true, he does.

HOST. Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy; I

HOSTESS. By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these	
HOSTESS. Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wot, wot thou!	
HUBERT. A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,	
HUBERT. Old men and beldams in the streets	
HUBERT. Peace; no more. Adieu.	
HUBERT. Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;	
HUBERT. Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night	
Had Death been French, then Death had died to-day.	
Had I been any god of power, I would	
Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,	
Had I it written, I would tear the word.	
Had I the pow'r that some say Dian had,	
Had from the conversation of my thoughts	
Had he done so to great and growing men,	
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,	
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,	
Had so much race to put it in my mind.	
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.	
Had time coher'd with place, or place with wishing,	
Hadst thou but lov'd him half so well as I,	
Hadst thou descended from another house.	
Ham.   A whole one I!	
Ham. 'The mobled queen'?	
Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,	
Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!	
Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?	
Ham. And smelt so? Pah!	
Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!	
Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!	
Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.	
Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,	
Ham. Ecstasy?	
Ham. For England?	
Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,	
Ham. Good madam!	
Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?	
Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.	
Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.	
Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?	
Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;	
Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this	
Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.	
Ham. Nay, but swear't.	
Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?	
Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,	
Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.	
Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!	
Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,	
Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.	
Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.	
Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.	
Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me	
Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any	
Ham. What woman then?	
Ham. What, frighted with false fire?	
Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.	
Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake	
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,	
Handlest in thy discourse. O, that her hand,	
Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.	
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,	
Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?	
Happiness courts thee in her best array;	
Hark how Troy roars; how Hecuba cries out;	
Harry's company. Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world!	
Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be King,	
Has business at his house; for all shall stay.	
Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,	
Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those	
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man	
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?	
Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?	
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,	
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!	
Hath banish'd me, his daughter?	
Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.	
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,	
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands	
Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine	
Hath had no notice of these accidents;	
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.	
Hath he so long held out with me, untir'd,	
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword	
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good Prince,	
Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?	
Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,	
Hath pluck'd him after.	
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?	
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.	
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.	
Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat	
Hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood.	
Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves;	
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?	
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,	
Hath thus stood for his country. Therefore please you,	
Hautboys.	
Hautboys. A small table under a state for the Cardinal,	
Have I done since I went.	
Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up	
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?	
Have been consider'd and debated on.	
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted	
Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.	
Have found the ground of study's excellence	
Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies.	
Have hent the gates, and very near upon	
Have holp to make this rescue?	
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms	
Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.	
Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship	
Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:	
Have more than merited.- All friends shall taste	
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.	
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary.	
Have their round haunches gor'd.	
Have we done aught amiss, show us wherein,	
Have we march'd on without impediment;	
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?	
Have we no wine here?	
Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desir'd	
Have with our needles created both one flower,	
Have you conspir'd, have you with these contriv'd,	
Having fully din'd before.	
He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-	
He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.	
He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens	
He bow'd his nature, never known before	
He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;	
He closes with you in this consequence:	
He comes down from the pulpit.	
He comes to bad intent.	
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times	
He did oppose his foe;	
He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?	
He dies to-night.	
He first presents his fire, and the high east	
He gains by death that hath such means to die.	
He gave his honours to the world again,	
He gave his nose, and took't away again;	
He had of me a chain; at five o'clock	
He had the wit which I can well observe	
He hath a kind of honour sets him of	
He hath a person and a smooth dispose	
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,	
He hath some message to deliver us.	
He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;	
He held me last night at least nine hours	
He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.	
He is not sick.	
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.	
He lov'd me-O false wench!-Give't me again.	
He made you for a highway to my bed;	
He means to recompense the pains you take	
He might have kept that glory to this day;	
He might have took his answer long ago.	
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you	
He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before.	
He needs must see himself.	
He never was so womanish; the cause	
He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.	
He plies the Duke at morning and at night,	
He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.	
He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,	
He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,	
He says he does, being then most flattered.	
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:	
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him	
He shall not breathe infection in this air	
He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.	
He should, for that, commit your godfathers.	
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine;	
He smil'd at it. I told him you were coming:	
He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand,	
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.	
He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.	
He spieth Falstaff on the ground.	
He started one poor heart of mine in thee.	
He still hath held them; that to's power he would	
He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,	
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found	
He that keeps nor crust nor crum,	
He then unto the ladder turns his back,	
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves;	
He told me Paris should have married Juliet.	
He walks by them and sings.	
He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,	
He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;	
He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and	
He was indeed the Duke; out o' th' substitution,	
He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty rotting	
He was perfumed like a milliner,	
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,	
He was your enemy; ever spake against	
He would have spoke to us.	
He'll grant the tribute, send th' arrearages,	
He'll so awake as he in fury shall	
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.	
He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,	
He's never anything but your true servant.	
He's strange and peevish.	
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,	
He, with two striplings- lads more like to run	
Hear but my name, and tremble.	
Hear me, Sir Thomas. Y'are a gentleman	
Heard you not what an humble suppliant	
Hearing you were retir'd, your friends fall'n off,	
Heart-hard'ning spectacles; tell these sad women	
Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray	
Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,	
Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil but the	
Heavens, that I were a lord!	
Heaviness in me.	
Hector! Look how he looks. There's a countenance! Is't not a	
Hector.	
Held current music too.	
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,	
Helen, I love thee, by my life I do;	
Helen. An she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a Friday	
Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.	
Help, help! Call help.	
Hence! Avaunt!	
Henry the Fifth. Whiles they each other cross,	
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;	
Her delicate cheek. It seem'd she was a queen	
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,	
Her father. I'll do something-                          Exit	
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,	
Her fruit trees all unprun'd, her hedges ruin'd,	
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master the Tiger;	
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten	
Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened	
Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake	
Her very silence and her patience,	
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,	
Her welcome friendly.	
Her worth, being mounted on the wind,	
Her. What are you?	
Here comes Navarre.	
Here comes Patroclus.	
Here comes the Emperor.	
Here comes your cousin.	
Here in this island we arriv'd; and here	
Here shall I die ashore-	
Here they fight, and certain Volsces come in the aid	
Here's Rome's young Captain, let him tell the tale;	
Here's a young lad fram'd of another leer.	
Here's eight that must take hands	
Here's goodly work!	
Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!	
Here's to your ladyship; and pledge it, madam,	
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,	
Hero. And here's another,	
Hero. So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,	
Hero. They know that do accuse me; I know none.	
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you	
Herself most chastely absent. After this,	
Hie to the Goths and raise an army there;	
Hie you to church; I must another way,	
High on a stage be placed to the view;	
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter	
Himself a king.	
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,	
Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel	
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.	
His army is a ragged multitude	
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart	
His beard was as white as snow,	
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!	
His child is like to her, fair as you are.	
His daughter first; and then in sequel, all,	
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,	
His eye begets occasion for his wit,	
His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.	
His favour is familiar to me. Boy,	
His fears were that the interview betwixt	
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,	
His folly to the mettle of my speech?	
His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd	
His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?	
His humorous predominance; yea, watch	
His insolence can brook to be commanded	
His insolence is more intolerable	
His issue disinherited should be;	
His lands to me, and took it on his death	
His lecture will be done ere you have tun'd.	
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]	
His means of death, his obscure funeral-	
His name and credit shall you undertake,	
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd	
His nighted life; moreover, to descry	
His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave	
His overmounting spirit; and there died,	
His own life hung upon the staff he threw-	
His own opinion was his law. I' th' presence	
His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me	
His present reconciliation take;	
His promises were, as he then was, mighty;	
His rage can do on me. You must be gone;	
His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit	
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,	
His regiment lies half a mile at least	
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains.	
His silence will sit drooping.	
His spell in that is out; the King hath found	
His steeds to water at those springs	
His time doth take.	
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,	
His valour, coin, and people, in the wars?	
His weapons, holy saws of sacred writ;	
His word might bear my wealth at any time.	
Hit with Cupid's archery,	
Hoists sails and flies.	
Hold me a foe-	
Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,	
Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.	
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.	
Hold, take my ring.	
Holding th' eternal spirit, against her will,	
Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,	
Hor. A piece of him.	
Hor. Half a share.	
Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.	
Hor. Is it a custom?	
Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England	
Hor. No, by no means!	
Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!	
Hor. That is most certain.	
Hor. What's that, my lord?	
Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He	
Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly	
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?	
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.	
Host. My lord, I pray you hear me.	
Hostility and civil tumult reigns	
Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.	
Hot. An if the devil come and roar for them,	
Hot. And I say the earth was not of my mind,	
Hot. And may be so we shall.	
Hot. And you in hell, as oft as he hears	
Hot. He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,	
Hot. Letters from him? Why comes he not himself?	
Hot. My uncle is return'd.	
Hot. Neither! 'Tis a woman's fault.	
Hot. No harm. What more?	
Hot. Not yours, in good sooth? Heart! you swear like a	
Hot. Sick now? droop now? This sickness doth infect	
Hot. Uncle, adieu. O, let the hours be short	
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?	
How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother?	
How covert matters may be best disclosed,	
How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,	
How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,	
How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me	
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown;	
How doth my lady? Is my father well?	
How dread an army hath enrounded him;	
How everything is chanced.                           Exeunt.	
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs	
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?	
How full of valour did he bear himself	
How goes the world, sir, now?	
How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.	
How ill this taper burns! Ha, who comes here?	
How in my words somever she be shent,	
How insolent of late he is become,	
How irksome is this music to my heart!	
How is't with you, my lord?	
How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.	
How it goes with us, and do look to know	
How like the Empress and her sons you are!	
How many makes the hour full complete,	
How many then should cover that stand bare!	
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!	
How much they do import, you would make haste.	
How much unlike art thou to Portia!	
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,	
How now! Is he dead?	
How now, Cassio!	
How now, Dame Partlet the hen? Have you enquir'd yet who pick'd	
How now, Master Brook. Master Brook, the matter will	
How now, fair maid?	
How now?	
How now? Where's your master?	
How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-	
How quickly were it gone!	
How shall I feast him? What bestow of him?	
How shall we find the concord of this discord?	
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is	
How soon this mightiness meets misery.	
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself	
How tame, when men and women are alone,	
How then might your prayers move!	
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;	
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,	
How will he scorn, how will he spend his wit!	
How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,	
How would thy shadow's form, form happy show,	
How, Simple! Where have you been? I must wait on	
How, in our means, we should advance ourselves	
How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?	
Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,	
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts	
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;	
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day,	
I am a most poor woman and a stranger,	
I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and	
I am a soldier and now bound to France.	
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire.	
I am an honest man's wife, and, setting thy knight-hood aside,	
I am as true as truth's simplicity,	
I am as woeful as Virginius was,	
I am asham'd that women are so simple	
I am beholding to you. Cheer your neighbours.	
I am bound to you.	
I am combined by a sacred vow,	
I am commanded, with your leave and favour,	
I am for other than for dancing measures.	
I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon	
I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.	
I am not glad that such a sore of time	
I am not mad; too well, too well I feel	
I am not such a truant since my coming,	
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,	
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour	
I am the last that will last keep his oath.	
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!	
I am thus resolv'd: on Sunday next you know	
I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.	
I am to blame to be thus waited for.	
I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.	
I am too high-born to be propertied,	
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my	
I am yet come to town. There's for your silence.	
I and my bosom must debate awhile,	
I and my brother are not known; yourself	
I and my sword will earn our chronicle.	
I ask your voices and your suffrages:	
I bade you never speak again of him;	
I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy; and tell	
I be misconst'red in the place I go to	
I bid for you as I'd buy.	
I can no further crawl, no further go;	
I can no more.	
I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.	
I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?	
I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,	
I cannot love him; let him send no more-	
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms	
I come one way of the Plantagenets.	
I come to know your pleasure.	
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.	
I come to visit the afflicted spirits	
I crave fit disposition for my wife,	
I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from me	
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.	
I did receive fair speechless messages.	
I do believe her though I know she lies,	
I do desire no more.	
I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?	
I do not lie.	
I do not so secure me in the error,	
I do not talk much.	
I do perceive here a divided duty.	
I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.	
I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit	
I drew to part them. In the instant came	
I faint almost to death.	
I faint. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.	
I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks	
I find the people strangely fantasied;	
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.	
I found by fortune and did give my husband,	
I found her trimming up the diadem	
I gave my love a ring, and made him swear	
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!	
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins	
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.                  Exit	
I have a king here to my flatterer.	
I have a king's oath to the contrary.	
I have been consul, and can show for Rome	
I have been long a sleeper, but I trust	
I have borne this business.	
I have by hard adventure found mine own.	
I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.	
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,	
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part	
I have got two worlds by't. O my gentle brothers,	
I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear,	
I have hope to Eve, and am prepar'd to die.	
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' th' fleet,	
I have made my way through more impediments	
I have no precious time at all to spend;	
I have received letters from great Rome	
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,	
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.	
I have serv'd you ever since I was a child;	
I have the patience to endure it now.	
I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,	
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night	
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,	
I here could pluck his Highness' frown upon you,	
I here renounce him and return to Henry.	
I hold my duty as I hold my soul,	
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?	
I honour'd him, I lov'd him, and will weep	
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon	
I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried.	
I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know	
I know Anne's mind for that; never a woman in Windsor	
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;	
I know my life so even. If your business	
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress.'	
I know not what. 'Tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis here,	
I know the shape of's leg; this is his hand,	
I know they do attend us.                             Exeunt	
I know thy constellation is right apt	
I know your back will bear a duchess. Say,	
I lay me down a little while to breathe;	
I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,	
I live with bread like you, feel want,	
I long to hear him call the drunkard 'husband';	
I long to know the truth hereof at large.	
I love him well; he is an honest man.	
I love not less, though less the show appear,	
I love thee so that, maugre all thy pride,	
I may not prove inferior to yourself.	
I mean to man, he had not apprehension	
I mean, my lords, those powers that the Queen	
I must acquaint you that I have receiv'd	
I must and will have Katherine to my wife.	
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.	
I must be held a rancorous enemy.	
I must be married to my brother's daughter,	
I must be round with him. Now he comes from hunting.	
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day,	
I must not have you henceforth question me	
I must offend before I be attainted;	
I ne'er saw Syracuse in my life.	
I never saw before. Great-bellied women,	
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester	
I ought to know of; and, upon my knees,	
I pardon him.	
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.	
I pray for heartily, that it may find	
I pray for no man but myself.	
I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.	
I pray thee, let us go and find him out,	
I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house.	
I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.	
I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes	
I pray you, turn the key, and keep our counsel.             Exit.	
I promised your presence and the chain;	
I rather of his absence make this use:	
I rather will subject me to the malice	
I run before King Harry's victory,	
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,	
I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so.	
I saw upon her finger.	
I say again there is no English soul	
I say again, hath made a gross revolt,	
I say again, if Lewis do will the day,	
I say at once let your brief plagues be mercy,	
I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in the Bunch of Grapes,	
I see thy grieved heart. Thy sad aspect	
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.	
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.	
I shall give worse payment.	
I shall have share in this most happy wreck.	
I shall not want false witness to condemn me	
I shall unfold equal discourtesy	
I should be author to dishonour you!	
I should do so in honour. I am in this	
I should fear those that dance before me now	
I should have found in some place of my soul	
I should lament thy miserable state.	
I should love thee but as a property.	
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,	
I should not make so dear a show of zeal.	
I should not seek an absent argument	
I should your lordship.	
I sick withal the help of bath desired,	
I slew him there.	
I speak of Africa and golden joys.	
I still win of you. For my sake wear this;	
I swear he is true-hearted, and a soul	
I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,	
I tell you true. Best you saf'd the bringer	
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;	
I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,	
I therein do forget.	
I think I shall command your welcome here,	
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast	
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,	
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.	
I took a costly jewel from my neck-	
I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.	
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.	
I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word	
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,	
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.	
I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,	
I was my chamber's prisoner.	
I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown,	
I was your mother much upon these years	
I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better	
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:	
I will appeach the villain.	
I will assume thy part in some disguise	
I will be master of what is mine own-	
I will but spend a word here in the house	
I will dismount, and by thy waggon wheel	
I will employ thee back again; I find thee	
I will from henceforth rather be myself,	
I will go seek the King.	
I will have such revenges on you both	
I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours, which	
I will not be afraid of death and bane	
I will not choose what many men desire,	
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose	
I will not fail her; speak it privately.	
I will not go to-day; and ere I do,	
I will not keep my word.	
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur	
I will not tarry; no, nor ever more	
I will not touch a bit.	
I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.	
I will resist such entertainment till	
I will subscribe- gentle adieus and greetings;	
I will take order for her keeping close.	
I will upon all hazards well believe	
I will with patience hear, and find a time	
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,	
I would adventure for such merchandise.	
I would applaud thee to the very echo,	
I would be trebled twenty times myself,	
I would entreat you rather to put on	
I would give it every foot to have this face!	
I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite,	
I would his troubles likewise were expir'd,	
I would invent as bitter searching terms,	
I would not be a young count in your way	
I would not be so sick though for his place.	
I would not change it.	
I would not for the world.	
I would not part a bachelor from the priest.	
I would prevail, if prayers might prevail	
I would swim after.	
I would, while it was smiling in my face,	
I' th' filthy mantled pool beyond your cell,	
I' th' plain way of his merit.	
I'd throw it down for your deliverance	
I'll apply	
I'll beat thee- but I should infect my hands.	
I'll bring you comfort.	
I'll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite.        [Sleeps]	
I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all	
I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.	
I'll hear his confessions justify;	
I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,	
I'll join with black despair against my soul	
I'll keep them, by this hand!	
I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.	
I'll make death love me; for I will contend	
I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,	
I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.	
I'll never give o'er. First, a very excellent good-conceited	
I'll not believe't.	
I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth	
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.	
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!	
I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him.	
I'll prove a busy actor in their play.                Exeunt	
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,	
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.	
I'll say as they say, and persever so,	
I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony	
I'll so offend to make offence a skill,	
I'll sort some other time to visit you.              [Going]	
I'll stir them to it.-Come, away, away!	
I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,	
I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.	
I'll take it as a peril to my soul	
I'll tell you what-I think it is our way,	
I'll think them every one an Antony,	
I'll tickle your catastrophe.	
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.	
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.                  Exit	
I'll to the King my master that is dead,	
I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.	
I'll undertake may see away their shilling	
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,	
I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake.'	
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,	
I'll yield myself to prison willingly,	
IACHIMO. Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?	
IACHIMO. He was expected then,	
IACHIMO. I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that	
IACHIMO. O happy Leonatus! I may say	
IACHIMO. They are in a trunk,	
IACHIMO. This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein he	
IAGO.                                  Why, go to then.	
IAGO.        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!	
IAGO. 'Sblood, but you will not hear me.	
IAGO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?	
IAGO. And so do I too, lieutenant.	
IAGO. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,	
IAGO. Demand me nothing; what you know, you know.	
IAGO. How now, what do you here alone?	
IAGO. I do not like the office;	
IAGO. I never knew a woman love man so.	
IAGO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;	
IAGO. My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.	
IAGO. My lord, for aught I know.	
IAGO. O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.	
IAGO. She gives it out that you shall marry her.	
IAGO. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips	
IAGO. So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.	
IAGO. What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to	
IAGO. Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.	
IAGO. Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he	
IAGO. You see this fellow that is gone before;	
IAGO. [Aside to Roderigo.] Away, I say; go out and cry a mutiny.	
IAGO. [Aside.] He takes her by the palm; ay, well said, whisper.	
IMOGEN. Am I one, sir?	
IMOGEN. Is he dispos'd to mirth? I hope he is.	
IMOGEN. It poison'd me.	
IMOGEN. Most like I did, for I was dead.	
IMOGEN. O! for such means,	
IMOGEN. Pray what is't?	
IMOGEN. True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,	
IMOGEN. What makes your admiration?	
INDUCTION.	
IRAS. Madam, O good Empress!	
IRAS. She's dead too, our sovereign.	
ISABELLA. Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,	
ISABELLA. Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,	
ISABELLA. Else let my brother die,	
ISABELLA. I am come to know your pleasure.	
ISABELLA. I would to heaven I had your potency,	
ISABELLA. My brother did love Juliet,	
ISABELLA. The better, given me by so holy a man.	
ISABELLA. This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.	
ISABELLA. To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.	
ISABELLA. When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,	
ISABELLA. Yes, brother, you may live:	
ISABELLA. Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,	
ISABELLA. Yet show some pity.	
If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,	
If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one	
If Henry were recall'd to life again,	
If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,	
If I departed not and left him there.	
If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!	
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it	
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,	
If I revolt, off goes young George's head;	
If I should swear by Jove's great attributes	
If I speak like a captain:	
If aught within that little seeming substance,	
If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.	
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,	
If each of you should take this course, how many

If for I want that glib and oily art	
If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,	
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend,	
If his chief good and market of his time	
If it be so, then both depart to him:	
If it should give your age such cause of fear.	
If law, authority, and power, deny not,	
If little faults proceeding on distemper	
If my suspect be false, forgive me, God;	
If none, he'll say in Troy, when he retires,

If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,	
If she unmask her beauty to the moon.	
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.            Exeunt	
If sorrow can admit society,        [Sitting down with them]

If that our noble father were alive?

If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,

If this man come to good.

If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him	
If thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice,	
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear	
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,	
If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,

If virtue no delighted beauty lack,	
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,

If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.	
If with a lady of so high resolve	
If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits-	
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,	
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,	
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries	
If you do not, if I be left alone,	
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,	
If you should tender your supposed aid,	
If you were civil and knew courtesy,	
If you will presently take horse with him	
If you'll bestow a small- of what you have little-	
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,

Imagine howling- 'tis too horrible.	
Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire	
Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth	
Impose me to what penance your invention	
In England the most valiant gentleman.	
In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation;	
In Hector's wrath.	
In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves,	
In Saturninus' health; whom, if she sleep,	
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks	
In a trice,	
In a wide sea of tax. No levell'd malice	
In action all of precept, he did show me	
In all her best array bear her to church;	
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.	
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,	
In any of our towns of garrison.	
In any summer house in Christendom).	
In aspiration lifts him from the earth.	
In best appointment all our regiments.	
In blood of those that had encount'red him.	
In borrow'd robes?	
In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,	
In censure of his seeming.	
In complement extern, 'tis not long after	
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great	
In country footing.	
In craving your opinion of my tide,	
In deadly hate the one against the other;	
In deep designs, in matter of great moment,	
In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,	
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,	
In end of autumn turned to the rams;	
In envy that my Lord Northumberland	
In every wound of Caesar that should move	
In fine, redeem'd I was as I desir'd.	
In forms imaginary, th'unguided days	
In fortune's love? For then the bold and coward,	
In further evil?	
In gentle numbers time so idly spent,	
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.	
In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,	
In haste post-haste are come to join with you;	
In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,	
In her behalf that scorns your services.	
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;	
In her strong toil of grace.	
In his own conduct, purposely to take	
In his own grace he doth exalt himself	
In his rage and his wrath,	
In honour of my noble Lord of York	
In it be memoriz'd.	
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!	
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.	
In life but double death,'now Gloucester's dead.	
In love, the heavens themselves do guide the state;	
In mind and feature. I persuade me from her	
In mine own country, lords.	
In mouths of wisest censure. What's the matter,	
In murders and in outrage boldly here;	
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.	
In my good brother's fault. I know not why	
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been	
In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us	
In qualities of the best. This man of thine	
In riddles and affairs of death,	
In seven short years that here my only son	
In short time after lie depos'd the King;	
In some reclusive and religious life,	
In spite of us or aught that we could do.	
In stamps that are forbid; 'tis all as easy	
In such a righteous fashion as I do,	
In such gross kind?	
In suff'ring thus thy brother to be slaught'red,	
In suit the place of's bed, and win this ring	
In the church-way paths to glide.	
In the contempt and anger of his lip!	
In the divorce his contrary proceedings	
In the relief of this oppressed child	
In the unpartial judging of this business.	
In the very end of harvest!	
In the vile prison of afflicted breath.	
In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.	
In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,	
In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man	
In this uncivil and unjust extent	
In this your cousin's death.	
In those freckles live their savours.	
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;	
In thy heart-blood, through being all too base	
In time will find their fit rewards. That seal	
In us, thy friend. Give me thy hand, stand up;	
In virtue than in vengeance; they being penitent,	
In vowing new hate after new love bearing:	
In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?	
In which addition, hail, most worthy Thane,	
In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.	
In your fine frame hath love no quality?	
In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,	
Incertainties now crown themselves assured,	
Incite them to quick motion; for I must	
Incline to it, or no?	
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.	
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;	
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,	
Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forc'd.	
Injurious distance should not stop my way,	
Instantly know, and of that letter too.	
Interpretation will misquote our looks,	
Into as many gobbets will I cut it	
Into baboon and monkey.	
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me	
Into my cousin's hands, Doctor Bellario;	
Into our city with thy banners spread.	
Into our hands, and to confine yourself	
Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty	
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,	
Into the good thoughts of the world again;	
Into the harsh and boist'rous tongue of war;	
Into the sea; and other times to see	
Into the service of the time, and was	
Into the staggers and the careless lapse	
Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;	
Into whose hand I give thy life.	
Inverness. Macbeth's castle.	
Invest me in my motley; give me leave	
Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats	
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.	
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath	
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king;	
Is all the grace I beg.	
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?	
Is all unpossible.	
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractis'd;	
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.	
Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,	
Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;	
Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;	
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;	
Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.	
Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'	
Is done to cure it.	
Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;	
Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid	
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:	
Is he not here?	
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.	
Is here attending; her business looks in her	
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,	
Is it thy will, thy image should keep open	
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;	
Is led on in the conduct of my will;	
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,	
Is like to lay upon us.	
Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time	
Is marching hitherward in proud array,	
Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.	
Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?	
Is my dear son with such sour company.	
Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,	
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?	
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths	
Is not this just? For I shall sutler be	
Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,	
Is overspread with them; therefore my grief	
Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,	
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,	
Is room enough. This earth that bears thee dead	
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,	
Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue	
Is sum of something which, to term in gross,	
Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire	
Is the fair hand that writ.	
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.	
Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.	
Is this a dagger which I see before me,	
Is this of hers? Lord Cardinal, will your Grace	
Is this the government of Britain's isle,	
Is this the man you speak of?	
Is this, in way of truth. Yet, ne'er the less,	
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.	
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;	
Is valour misbegot, and came into the world	
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,	
Is't not so?	
Is't possible that my deserts to you	
Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,	
It be to do thee service.	
It boots not to resist both wind and tide.	
It cannot be avoided but by this;	
It cannot be but he was murd'red here:	
It cannot be but thou hast murd'red him;	
It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so;	
It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart.	
It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed.	
It fears not policy that heretic,	
It follows in his thought that I am he.	
It hath in solemn synods been decreed,	
It hath no end.	
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,	
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone	
It is a manacle of love; I'll place it	
It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear	
It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,	
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly;	
It is not night when I do see your face,	
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,	
It is too little, helping him to all;	
It is writ to Jaquenetta.	
It is your fault that I have lov'd Posthumus.	
It may be judg'd I made the Duke away;	
It may be these apparent prodigies,	
It may do good. Pride hath no other glass	
It may lie gently at the foot of peace	
It must not be. If Cassio do remain,	
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,	
It shall be eas'd, if France can yield relief.	
It should be challeng'd.	
It should be look'd to. Come.                         Exeunt	
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.	
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.	
It stands in like request?	
It struck mine ear most terribly.	
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls	
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,	
It was the swift celerity of his death,	
It will go hard with poor Antonio.	
It will not be-retire into your trenches.	
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.

Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.	
Let not the piece of virtue which is set	
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be	
Let our drums strike.                                 Exeunt	
Let us not leave till all our own be won.	
Let us survey the vantage of the ground.	
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;	
Let's call more help to have them bound again.	
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,	
Let's mock them still, as well known as disguis'd.	
Let's step into the shadow of these trees.	
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;	
Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn;	
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,	
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.	
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile	
Lie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.	
Lies heavy on me. O, my heart is sick!	
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,	
Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale	
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.	
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.	
Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?	
Like an unseasonable stormy day	
Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?	
Like monsters of the deep.	
Like one that draws the model of a house	
Like perspectives which, rightly gaz'd upon,	
Like to a dismal clangor heard from far,	
Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves	
Like to a ship that, having scap'd a tempest,	
Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,	
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey

MUSTARDSEED, fairy	
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until	
Madam, I have a secret to reveal.	
Madam, I was not old Sir Robert's son;	
Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.	
Made glory base, and sovereignty a slave,	
Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,	
Made more or less by thy continual haste:	
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride	
Made scruple of his praise, and wager'd with him	
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong,	
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,	
Magic of bounty, all these spirits thy power	
Maintain I know not what; 'tis trash. Farewell.	
Maintain a mourning ostentation,	
Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence,	
Make good this ostentation, and you shall	
Make me believe that thou art only mark'd	
Make much of him, my lords; for this is he	
Make the sun dance. Hark you!               [A shout within]	
Make thee another self for love of me,	
Make us pay down for our offence by weight	
Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war	
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen- your son	
Makes it take head from all indifferency,	
Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;	
Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still!	
Makes wing to the rooky wood;	
Making the green one red.	
Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;	
Many dream not to find, neither deserve,

Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy	
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters	
Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up	
Mark how one string sweet husband to another,	
Marking th' embarked traders on the flood;	
Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger	
Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old	
Master Surecard, as I think?	
May all the building in my fancy pluck	
May all to Athens back again repair,	
May be a devil; and the devil hath power	
May catch a wrench- would all were well!- 'tis pity-	
May hold him from the Capitol today.	
May make a peaceful and a sweet retire	
May not extend so far as to the lady;	
May prove his travel, not her danger.	
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,	
May that ground gape, and swallow me alive,	
May turn the tide of fearful faction	
Me seemeth good that, with some little train,	
Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,	
Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,	
Meeting the check of such another day;	
Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures	
Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;	
Men at some time are masters of their fates:	
Men of great worth resorted to this forest,	
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run

Mess. A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuff'd with all honourable	
Mess. But few of any sort, and none of name.	
Mess. I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the	
Mess. My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,	
Messengers, English and French Attendants. Fiends appearing	
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:	
Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,	
Methinks already in this civil broil	
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse	
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,	
Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age,	
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.	
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,	
Might be a copy to these younger times;	
Might have the freer course.	
Might liquid tears, or heart-offending groans,	
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.	
Might with a sally of the very town	
Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny;	
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,	
Mine interest and his honour; or have charg'd him,

Mine own, and not mine own.	
Mine were the very cipher of a function,	
Minions of the Moon; and let men say we be men of good	
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.	
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;	
Mock not that I affect the untraded oath;	
Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.	
Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?	
More daring or more bold, is now alive	
More fearful, is deliver'd.	
More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary	
More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child	
More larger list of sceptres.	
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof	
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;	
More truly now may this be verified;	
More venturous or desperate than this.	
More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.	
Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here	
Mort. I understand thy looks. That pretty Welsh	
Mortimer his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call	
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.	
Most hungerly on your sight.	
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust	
Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him	
Most throughly for my father.	
Mother. What noise is here?	
Mov'd with remorse of these outrageous broils,	
Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader.	
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,	
Music plays, and they dance.	
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.	
Must curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this story	
Must fall out with men too. What the declin'd is,	
Must give this cur the lie; and his own notion-	
Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif!	
Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,	
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.	
Must now confess, if they have any goodness,	
My army but a weak and sickly guard;	
My art is not past power nor you past cure.	
My best esteem'd acquaintance; hie thee, go.	
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;	
My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.	
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,	
My boon I make it that you know me not	
My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think	
My brain, more busy than the labouring spider,	
My conscience bids me ask- wherefore you have	
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,	
My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,	
My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know	
My fame is shrewdly gor'd.	
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.	
My father is here look'd for every day	
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,	
My figur'd goblets for a dish of wood,	
My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd	
My friends of noble touch; when I am forth,	
My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.	
My grandsire, well advis'd, hath sent by me	
My hand cut off and made a merry jest;	
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,	
My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty	
My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;	
My heart is turn'd to stone; and while 'tis mine	
My innocent life against an emperor.	
My lady's honour. What became of him	
My liege! my lord! But now a king-now thus.	
My lord, so please you, these things further thought on,	
My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,	
My master and his man are both broke loose,	
My master stays in the street.	
My master's enemy.	
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;	
My mistress will before the break of day	
My mother told me just how he would woo,	
My mourning and important tears hath pitied.	
My name is Edgar and thy father's son.	
My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him;	
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.	
My noble partners and myself thus pray:	
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,	
My people are with sickness much enfeebled;	
My princely father then had wars in France	
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time	
My residence in Rome at one Philario's,	
My reverend father, let it not be so!	
My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword	
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.	
My spirit can no longer bear these harms.	
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile	
My tears are now prevailing orators.	
My tender years; and let us not forgo	
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.	
My title's good, and better far than his.	
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-	
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words,	
My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad.	
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow	
My vouch against you, and my place i' th' state,	
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,	
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.	
My worth unknown, no loss is known in me;	
Myself dispos'd to sleep.

Nay, an 'a do nothing but speak nothing, 'a shall be nothing	
Nay, come, let's go together.	
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,	
Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive	
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.	
Near the camp of COMINIUS	
Needs must I under my transgression bow,	
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business	
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:	
Never bestrid a horse, save one that had	
Never to lie and take his natural rest	
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,	
No big-bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops' size;	
No deeper wrinkles yet? Hath sorrow struck	
No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.	
No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;	
No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance	
No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me	
No less in pity than his glory which	
No less in truth than life. My first false speaking	
No longer Celia, but Aliena.	
No longer session hold upon my shame,	
No more to undertake it, I will work him	
No other speaker of my living actions,	
No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,	
No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter	
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,	
No traveller returns- puzzles the will,	
No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon	
No villainous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;	
No word to save thee.	
No, I will weep no more. In such a night	
No, Leonato,	
No, he must die. Be't so. I hear him coming.	
No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not.	
No, if thou dost say no to my demand.	
No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been	
No, no, my heart will burst, an if I speak-	
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.	
No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,	
No.	
No; many a pound of mine own proper store,	
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.	
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjur'd men.	
Nor I, nor any man that but man is,	
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron	
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,	
Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces	
Nor either cares for him.	
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd.	
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark	
Nor longer stay in your curst company.	
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass-	
Nor mark prodigious, such as are	
Nor never look upon each other's face;	
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.	
Nor of them look for such observancy	
Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.               Exeunt	
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace;	
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,	
Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,	
Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds	
North. At Berkeley Castle.	
Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,	
Not able to endure the sight of day,	
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,	
Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you,	
Not by might mast'red, but by special grace.	
Not cowardly put off my helmet to	
Not far, one Muliteus, my countryman-	
Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,	
Not he which says the dead is not alive.	
Not his that spoils her young before her face.	
Not many moons gone by.	
Not mine to speak on't.	
Not of that dye which their investments show,	
Not rascal-like to fall down with a pinch,	
Not seeing what is likely to ensue.	
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear	
Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.	
Not to outsport discretion.	
Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;	
Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him	
Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not.         Exit	
Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd	
Nothing of him that doth fade	
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three	
Now am I dead,	
Now are frolic. Not a mouse	
Now bind my brows with iron; and approach	
Now bring them in, for I will play the cook,	
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?	
Now cheer each other in each other's love.	
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;	
Now death shall stop his dismal threat'ning sound,	
Now do you know the reason of this haste.	
Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,	
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty	
Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,	
Now for this night let's harbour here in York;	
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy;	
Now if you have a station in the file,	
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,	
Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?	
Now is the day we long have looked for;	
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland	
Now is this golden crown like a deep well	
Now my charms are all o'erthrown,	
Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.        [Dies]	
Now my soul's palace is become a prison.	
Now spurs the lated traveler apace	
Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!	
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought	
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,	
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,	
Now! whence come you?	
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind-	
Now, Charmian!	
Now, I fear thee not.	
Now, by mine honour which is yet mine own,	
Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,	
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!	
Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.	
Now, my Lord Constable!	
Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca	
Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.	
Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,	
Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum	
Nurse to Juliet.	
Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.	
Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!	
Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo	
Nurse. Marry, bachelor,	
Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.	
Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me	
Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!	
Nurse. Romeo can,

Nym, sir, that beguil'd him of a chain, had the chain or no.	
O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!	
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,	
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!                          Exit Silvius	
O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,	
O blame me not if I no more can write!	
O call not me to justify the wrong,	
O cunning, how I got it!- nay, some marks	
O for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?	
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,	
O heavy times, begetting such events!	
O ho! a while, but ha! ha! ha!	
O if (I say) you look upon this verse,	
O love's best habit is in seeming trust,	
O masters! If I were disposed to stir	
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?	
O my Antonio, had I but the means	
O my Lord Aberga'ny, fare you well!	
O none, unless this miracle have might,	
O short-liv'd pride! Not fair? Alack for woe!	
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem	
O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;	
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,	
O what a happy title do I find,	
O' th' dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary	
O' th' world, I would pursue it.	
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;	
O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice	
O'erborne their way, consum'd with fire and took	
O, I should have a heavy miss of thee	
O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,	
O, he's a lovely gentleman!	
O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!         [They sleep]	
O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!	
O, in this love, you love your child so ill	
O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,	
O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.	
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,	
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,	
O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?	
O, prepare it!	
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,	
O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,	
O, two such silver currents, when they join,	
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,	
O, welcome home! And welcome, General.	
O, what a scandal is it to our crown	
OBERON. Fare thee well, nymph; ere he do leave this grove,	
OBERON. Having once this juice,	
OBERON. How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,	
OBERON. This falls out better than I could devise.	
OBERON. This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak'st,	
OCTAVIA. O my good lord,	
OCTAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,	
OCTAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.	
OCTAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.	
OFFICER. Good now, hold thy tongue.	
OFFICER. Good sir, be patient.

OLIVIA'S garden	
OLIVIA. A gentleman! What gentleman?	
OLIVIA. Ay, marry; what is he?	
OLIVIA. By mine honour, half drunk! What is he at the gate, cousin?	
OLIVIA. Go call him hither.                         Exit MARIA	
OLIVIA. I do I know not what, and fear to find	
OLIVIA. It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I

OLIVIA. Take the fool away.	
OLIVIA. Tell him he shall not speak with me.	
OLIVIA. What say'st thou?	
OLIVIA. Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.	
OLIVIA. Who of my people hold him in delay?	
OLIVIA. You might do much.	
ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,	
ORLANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.	
ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence	
ORLANDO. O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.	
ORLANDO. What, of my suit?	
ORLANDO. Who ambles Time withal?	
ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?	
ORLEANS	
ORLEANS. Your mistress bears well.	
OTHELLO.                             He, woman;	
OTHELLO.                            I think thou dost;	
OTHELLO.                         I know, Iago,	
OTHELLO.                        It is even so.	
OTHELLO.              Farewell, farewell.	
OTHELLO. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for

OTHELLO. Did he confess it?	
OTHELLO. Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?	
OTHELLO. Fear not my government.	
OTHELLO. Give me a living reason she's disloyal.	
OTHELLO. Ha!	
OTHELLO. Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her	
OTHELLO. Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?	
OTHELLO. I am not sorry neither. I'ld have thee live,	
OTHELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,	
OTHELLO. It is the very error of the moon;	
OTHELLO. Not Cassio kill'd! Then murther's out of tune,	
OTHELLO. Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.	
OTHELLO. The servants of the Duke? And my lieutenant?	
OTHELLO. The tyrant custom, most grave senators,	
OTHELLO. The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.	
OTHELLO. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?	
OTHELLO. Well, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to dissemble!	
OTHELLO. Well, thou dost best.	
OTHELLO. What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.	
OTHELLO. With her?	
OTHELLO. Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.	
OXFORD. Women and children of so high a courage,	
Obedience bids I should not bid again.	
Obedience, which you owe your father. For	
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;	
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,	
Observ'd his courtship to the common people;	
Observe degree, priority, and place,	
Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt	
Of France and England, whose very shores look pale	
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid.	
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish	
Of all his people shall revolt from him,	
Of all the days of the year, upon that day;	
Of all the voices that we have procur'd,	
Of all their conference. If she find him not,	
Of all these learned men, she was divorc'd,	
Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown	
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live	
Of being taken by the insolent foe	
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,	
Of bragging horror; so shall inferior eyes,	
Of burning cressets, and at my birth	
Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt	
Of credit infinite, highly belov'd,	
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,	
Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter!	
Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;	
Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,	
Of estimation and command in arms.	
Of excellent dumb discourse.	
Of her I am to speak.	
Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,	
Of him that caus'd it.	
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue	
Of his bright passage to the occident.	
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.	
Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,	
Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit,	
Of marching to Philippi presently?	
Of merchant-marring rocks?	
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,	
Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shall find time	
Of my true mother.	
Of no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose	
Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?	
Of others' voices, that my adder's sense,	
Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence.	
Of parents good, of fist most valiant.	
Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;	
Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tent,	
Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt	
Of secret on her person, that he could not	
Of singular integrity and learning,	
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,	
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;	
Of ten times double gain of happiness.	
Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;	
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,	
Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points	
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.	
Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,	
Of their own choice. One's Junius Brutus-	
Of these Italian weeds, and suit myself	
Of these exactions, yet the King our master-	
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;	
Of this new sect? Ye are not sound.	
Of this remove.	
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue	
Of thy nativity. I would the milk	
Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,	
Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,	
Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,	
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:	
Of what you promis'd me.	
Of yonder knight?	
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken	
Of your great danger.	
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?	
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate	
Officers, Soldiers, Messengers, and Attendants	
Old Man. O my good lord,	
Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice	
Old fools are babes again, and must be us'd	
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'	
Older in practice, abler than yourself	
Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?	
On Athens, ripe for stroke. Thou cold sciatica,	
On chalic'd flow'rs that lies;	
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,	
On him I lay that you would lay on me-	
On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting	
On him, his sons, his favourites, and his friends.	
On his fair worth and single chivalry.                     Exeunt	
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?	
On objects, arts, and imitations,	
On some apparent danger seen in him	
On this Ascension-day, remember well,	
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,	
On whose employment I was sent to you.	
On you than any, so your hand and heart,	
On your imaginary forces work.	
On, Myrmidons, and cry you an amain	
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,	
Once in a sea-fight 'gainst the Count his galleys	
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.	
Once, and a million!	
One blushing shame, another white despair:	
One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,	
One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun	
One half of me is yours, the other half yours-	
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,	
One that compos'd your beauties; yea, and one	
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,	
One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure,	
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,	
Only about her coronation.	
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;	
Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin	
Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.	
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]	
Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,

Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!	
Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine;	
Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,	
Or God will punish me. I do believe,	
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,	
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.	
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever	
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;	
Or a dog that seems a-sleeping,	
Or add a royal number to the dead,	
Or all or lose his hire.	
Or as the snake, roll'd in a flow'ring bank,	
Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,	
Or break it all to pieces; or there we'll sit,	
Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?	
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,	
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite	
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.	
Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king.	
Or die renowned by attempting it.	
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,	
Or else good night your vow!	
Or else the law of Athens yields you up-	
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.	
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,	
Or get some little knife between thy teeth	
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;	
Or if of grief, being altogether had,	
Or in the beached margent of the sea,	
Or is it Dian, habited like her,	
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?	
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.	
Or it will seek me in another place,	
Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?	
Or lose mine arm for't. Thou hast beat me out	
Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so	
Or my friends, if I should need 'em.	
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,	
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,	
Or say 'tis not your seal, not your invention;	
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?

Or shall we think the subtle-witted French

Or void the field; they do offend our sight.

Or would have done't myself. Your emperor	
Or wrath or craft may get him.	
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.	
Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child	
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship	
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.	
Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil

Other Spirits attending on Prospero	
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;	
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.	
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay	
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,	
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.	
Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so	
Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,	
Our coronation. Lords, prepare yourselves.	
Our courtiers say all's savage but at court.	
Our duty this way lies. For God's sake, come.	
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter	
Our eldest-born, speak first.	
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd	
Our grandam earth, having this distemp'rature,	
Our hard-rul'd King. Again, there is sprung up	
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition	
Our house is hell; and thou, a merry devil,	
Our human generation you shall find	
Our instruments to melancholy bells,	
Our landmen will stand up.	
Our love was new, and then but in the spring,	
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.	
Our pleasure?	
Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes	
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods	
Our project's life this shape of sense assumes-	
Our services awhile; but my full heart	
Our setting down before't.	
Our terrible approach.	
Our title to the crown, and only claim	
Our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going	
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceiv'd.	
Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.	
Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us.	
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought	
Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;	
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE. No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.	
PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;

Paid ere he promis'd; whereby his suit was granted	
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face.	
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?

Pare thy nails, dad.

Partly for that her promised proportions	
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?	
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide-	
Patience awhile, you'st hear the belly's answer.	
Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not

Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.

Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,	
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,	
Pluck me out all the linen.	
Pluck their hearts from them! Not to-day, O Lord,

Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone.	
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.	
Possessing or pursuing no delight	
Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart-	
Power as he was a councillor to try him,	
Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace! For certain,	
Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.	
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him	
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.	
Prettily, methought, did play the orator.	
Prevented from a damned enterprise.	
Prince Troilus, I have lov'd you night and day	
Prince's subjects.

Prince. Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick!	
Prince. Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like	
Prince. How now, my lady the hostess? What say'st thou to me?	
Prince. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours	
Prince. I did never see such pitiful rascals.	
Prince. I do, I will.                      [A knocking heard.]	
Prince. I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already

Prince. Thou judgest false already. I mean, thou shalt have the

Prince. What's the matter?	
Prithee call Gardiner to me, my new secretary;	
Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?	
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?	
Produce his body to the marketplace,	
Pronounce dishonour of her-by my life,	
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower	
Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,	
Protector	
Proud can I never be of what I hate,	
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,	
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,	
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,	
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;	
Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall die. How a good yoke	
Puff'd his own brother. And can he be angry?	
Put but a little water in a spoon	
Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame	
Put on a most importunate aspect,	
Put rancors in the vessel of my peace	
Puts the wretch that lies in woe

QUEEN ELIZABETH. I go. Write to me very shortly,

Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.	
Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,	
Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.	
Queen. To whom do you speak this?

Queen. What would she have?	
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary

ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a

ROSALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon	
ROSALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall	
ROSALIND. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my

She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,	
She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,	
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:	
She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite	
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss	
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,	
She is young, and of a noble modest nature;	
She is your own. Else, you must pardon me;	
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.	
She may do more, sir, than denying that:	
She shall be lov'd and fear'd. Her own shall bless her:	
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.     Exit Servant.	
She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;	
She was a vixen when she went to school;

Should be as holy as severe;	
Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,	
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!	
Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd	
Should be the father of some stratagem.	
Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,	
Should hazard such a place as his own second	
Should in the farthest East bean to draw	
Should make desire vomit emptiness,	
Should not become my wife and England's Queen.

Signior Andpholus, I wonder much	
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;	
Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.	
Since I heard thence; these are the words- I think	
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled	
Since doubting things go ill often hurts more	
Since every one, hath every one, one shade,	
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.	
Since nature cannot choose his origin,-	
Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,	
Since she is living, let the time run on	
Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak.	
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.	
Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.	
Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.	
Sing and disperse 'em, if thou canst. Leave working.	
Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;	
Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.

So Suffolk had thy heavenly company;	
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,	
So all my best is dressing old words new,	
So all their praises are but prophecies	
So are those crisped snaky golden locks	
So as thou liv'st in peace, die free from strife;	
So bad an instrument; his name's Parolles.	
So cowardly; and but for these vile 'guns,	
So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,	
So distribution should undo excess,	
So early waking- what with loathsome smells,	
So every scope by the immoderate use	
So excellent a king, that was to this	
So far from variation or quick change?	
So far'd our father with his enemies;	
So foul a sky clears not without a storm.	
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,	
So get the start of the majestic world	
So hot a speed with such advice dispos'd,	
So in his red blood Cassius' day is set,	
So is the equal poise of this fell war.	
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round	
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,	
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,	
So many courses of the sun enthroned,	
So mighty are his vowed enemies.	
So now I have confessed that he is thine,	
So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,	
So safely ordered that there is no soul-	
So season'd with your faithful love to me,	
So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means	
So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!	
So tender over his occasions, true,	
So that eternal love in love's fresh case,	
So that my lord your son were not my brother-	
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,	
So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.	
So the proportions of defence are fill'd;	
So the revenge alone pursu'd me! Polydore,	
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,	
So to enforce or qualify the laws	
So true men yield, with robbers so o'er-match'd.	
So will I those that kept me company.	
So you do condescend to help me now.	
So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing,	
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand	
So, farewell, Reignier. Set this diamond safe	
So, farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.	
So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge	
So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.	
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:	
So, when this loose behaviour I throw off	
Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,	
Soldiers, Attendants, Messengers, Watchmen, etc.	
Soldiers, this day have you redeem'd your lives,	
Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,	
Some better than his value- on the moment	
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran	
Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to	
Some fair excuse.	
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,	
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:	
Some little memory of me will stir him-	
Some little time; so by your companies	
Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.	
Some nobler token I have kept apart	
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;	
Some private speech with you.	
Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes	
Some stay to see him fast'ned in the earth.	
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover;	
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,	
Some, how brief the life of man	
Something to save thy life.	
Sometime in Greece-	
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,	
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,	
Sometimes I'll say I am Duke Humphrey's wife,	
Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,	
Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.            Exit	
Sound drum and trumpets and to London all;	
Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:	
Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!	
Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.	
Speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.	
Speak, for my heart is full.	
Speak; tell me.

Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,	
Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee	
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?	
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil.	
Tell them, when that my mother went with child	
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me,	
Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!        Exit	
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,	
Th' effect of what I wrote?	
Th' estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone,	
Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,	
Th' incensing relics of it; let him approach,	
Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!	
Th' uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;	
Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see	
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.	
Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,	
Than Venus, or those pamp'red animals	
Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,	
Than are upon you yet.	
Than at the strangeness of it.	
Than baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheep,	
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me:	
Than by self-offences weighing.	
Than by the negligent.	
Than can my care-tun'd tongue deliver him.	
Than can my ears that tragic history.	
Than customary bounty can enforce you.	
Than die for this.	
Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,	
Than drink so much in one.	
Than ever Greek did couple in his arms;	
Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg	
Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,	
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.	
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate	
Than is his use.	
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,	
Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,	
Than prais'd for harmful mildness.	
Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you	
Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.	
Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,	
Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.	
Than the performance of our heaving spleens,	
Than thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.	
Than this: that nothing do I see in you-	
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns.	
Than to entreaty.	
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags	
Than with your weapons.	
Than you much willing to be counted wise	
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell	
Thanks, courteous wall. Jove shield thee well for this!	
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,	
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.	
That England was defam'd by tyranny.	
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,	
That I account them blessings; for by these	
That I am forc'd to lay my reverence by	
That I am that same wall; the truth is so;	
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;	
That I desire to hear her speak again,	
That I have been your wife in this obedience	
That I kiss aught but he.	
That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.	
That I may save my speech. Do but go after,	
That I must call't in question.	
That I profess myself in banqueting	
That I should do what I abhor to name,	
That I should questionless be fortunate.	
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,	
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,	
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;	
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come	
That Margaret shall be Queen, and none but she.	
That Nature pranks her in attracts my soul.	
That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.	
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.            Exit	
That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;	
That all I see in you is worthy love,	
That all in England did repute him dead-	
That all particulars of duty know	
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd	
That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,	
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,	
That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:	
That are recorded in this schedule here.	
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,	
That at his will he may do danger with.	
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue	
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run	
That before you, and next unto high heaven,	
That better is, by evil still made better.	
That borrow their behaviours from the great,	
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!	
That brought you forth this boy to keep your name	
That bucket down and fun of tears am I,	
That burn by day and night; and then I lov'd thee,	
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,	
That can my speech defuse, my good intent	
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,	
That capability and godlike reason	
That clogs me with this answer."	
That come to hear a merry bawdy play,	
That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;	
That could not live asunder day or night.	
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart-	
That cries 'Retire!' if Warwick bid him stay.	
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,	
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;	
That did display them when we first march'd forth;	
That do renown this city.	
That does afflict each other!	
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.	
That done, dissever your united strengths	
That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague	
That doth sustain my house; you take my life	
That ebb and flow by th' moon.	
That end upon them should be executed.	
That even now he cries aloud for him.	
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;	
That ever I was born to set it right!	
That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods	
That ever death should let life bear his name,	
That ever turn'd their- backs- to mortal views!	
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone	
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound	
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,	
That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!	
That followed it as gentle day,	
That for the beauty thinks it excellent.	
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'	
That from this castle's tottered battlements	
That gave th' affront with them.	
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling	
That grows not in a fair consent with ours;	
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,	
That hadst a wife once call'd Aemilia,	
That has to-day escap'd. I thank you all;	
That hast by tyranny these many years	
That hath dishonoured Gloucester's honest name.	
That hath so long been resident in France?	
That haunted us in our familiar paths.	
That having such a scope to show her pride,	
That he did range the town to seek me out.	
That he enchants societies into him,	
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!	
That he is lov'd of me; I follow him not	
That he is march'd to Bordeaux with his power	
That he should be so abject, base, and poor,	
That he should hither come as this dire night	
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.	
That he will neither know how to maintain it	
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together	
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!	
That here were well begun and well begot;	
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.	
That idles in the wanton summer air,	
That in the very refuse of thy deeds,	
That in the way of loyalty and truth	
That in this quarrel have been overthrown	
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!	
That is now answer'd.	
That it may stand till the perpetual doom	
That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.	
That it runs over even at his eyes.	
That it shall render vengeance and revenge	
That kill'd thy daughter; villain-like, I lie-	
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.     Exit SERVANT	
That knows his valour and knows not his fear,	
That labour on the bosom of this sphere	
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,	
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul	
That live and feed upon your Majesty.	
That longer you desire the court, as well	
That love my friend, and that they know full well	
That love the fundamental part of state	
That makes the Senate ugly.	
That man i' th' world who shall report he has	
That many maz'd considerings did throng	
That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,	
That might relieve you!	
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?	
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,	
That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain	
That never slept a quiet hour with thee	
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits	
That none shall have access unto Bianca	
That one by one pursue; if you give way,	
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.	
That only like a gulf it did remain	
That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's,	
That patter with us in a double sense,	
That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.	
That plats the manes of horses in the night	
That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?	
That policy may either last so long,	
That poor retention could not so much hold,	
That promise noble service; and they come	
That reacheth from the restful English Court	
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.	
That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,	
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit.	
That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal	
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.	
That should deracinate such savagery;	
That show, contain, and nourish, all the world,	
That sin by him advantage should achieve,	
That so her torture may be shortened.	
That so neglected you.	
That speaks he knows not what?	
That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,	
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand	
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they	
That still I lay upon my mother's head;	
That stroke would prove the worst!	
That takes away by any secret course	
That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.	
That tempts most cunningly. But be not tempted.	
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here	
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,	
That the graves, all gaping wide,	
That the mad Brutus ended; he alone	
That the united vessel of their blood,	
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat	
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,	
That they did give the rings away to men;	
That they have done't?	
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,	
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else	
That this our court, infected with their manners,	
That this same child of honour and renown,	
That those which fly before the battle ends	
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.	
That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.	
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.	
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;	
That thou might'st think upon these by the seal,	
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which	
That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again	
That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours	
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress	
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men	
That thought them sure of you.	
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?	
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,	
That very oft we pity enemies.	
That visit my sad heart.	
That we may bring you something on the way.	
That we may call it early by-and-by.	
That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile	
That wear those colours on them. What art thou	
That were excusable, that and thousands more	
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,	
That were the cause of my imprisonment.	
That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;	
That which his noble ancestors achiev'd with blows.	
That which so often you did bid me steal.	
That which t' appear itself must not yet be	
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks;	
That will not be denied your Highness' presence.	
That will not hold the handling. Or say to them	
That winter lion, who in rage forgets	
That wish'd him on the barren mountains starve.	
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,	
That with the King here resteth in his tent?	
That with the hurly death itself awakes?	
That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me,	
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.	
That would to cinders burn up modesty,	
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,	
That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.	
That you are odd, and he is even with you.	
That you know well. Something it is I would-	
That you start at it? I say I am your mother,	
That your activity may defeat and quell	
That youth and observation copied there,	
That's the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,	
That's the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb	
That, Escalus.	
That, being of so young clays brought up with him,	
That, by confessing them, the souls of men	
That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,	
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross	
That, were I ta'en here, it would scarce be answer'd.	
That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,	
That, when the exigent should come- which now	
The Bishop will be overborne by thee.	
The British camp, near Dover.	
The Devil himself.	
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together	
The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,	
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.	
The Emperor's court is like the house of Fame,	
The Forest of Arden	
The Forum.	
The French camp near Agincourt	
The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms;	
The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together	
The Garter Inn	
The Ghost of Banquo and other Apparitions	
The Ghost of Caesar	
The Grecians' cause.	
The Greek camp	
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,	
The KING retires attended	
The King by me requests your presence straight.	
The King had cut off my head with my brother's.	
The King my father shall be made acquainted	
The King with mighty and quick-raised power	
The King's camp near Shrewsbury.	
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died	
The PORTER opens the gate	
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world	
The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,	
The Senate House	
The Tuscan service, freely have they leave	
The Viscount Rochford-one of her Highness' women.	
The Volscians are dislodg'd, and Marcius gone.	
The Welshmen are dispers'd; and Salisbury	
The action of their bodies from their souls;	
The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now.	
The actors are at band; and, by their show,	
The age to come would say this poet lies,	
The air will drink the sap. To every county	
The anvil of my sword, and do contest	
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!	
The back is sacrifice to th' load. They say	
The badges of his grief and patience,	
The beachy girdle of the ocean	
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,	
The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.	
The bell then beating one-	
The benefit thereof is always granted	
The best persuasions to the contrary	
The bitter disposition of the time	
The blood I drop is rather physical	
The bloody office of his timeless end.	
The body of the country, city, court,	
The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolv'd, and loos'd;	
The boy gives warning something doth approach.	
The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out,	
The breath of worldly men cannot depose	
The business we have talk'd of.	
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,	
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,	
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;	
The citizens are mum, say not a word.	
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,	
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,	
The congregated college have concluded	
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;	
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them,	
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,	
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;	
The credit that thy lady hath of thee	
The cuckoo then on every tree	
The damned'st body to invest and cover	
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,	
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;	
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,	
The dedicated words which writers use	
The deep damnation of his taking-off,	
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!	
The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven.	
The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it.	
The dignity of your office, is the point	
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;	
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind	
The due of honour in no point omit.	
The element itself, till seven years' heat,	
The element they liv'd in. In his livery	
The emptier ever dancing in the air,	
The envious barking of your saucy tongue	
The envious load that lies upon his heart;	
The fam'd Cassibelan, who was once at point-	
The fashion- less without and more within.              Exit	
The fault's your own.	
The favours of these men. Were they not mine?	
The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green.	
The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms.	
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;	
The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,	
The fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er	
The flat unraised spirits that hath dar'd	
The flattering index of a direful pageant,	
The fool no knave, perdy.	
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.          Exit	
The forest	
The forest	
The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,	
The galloping of horse. Who wast came by?	
The garden here is more convenient.	
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,	
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads	
The general cause? Or is it a fee-grief	
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices	
The gods confound- hear me, you good gods all-	
The gods defend him from so great a shame!	
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene	
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if	
The great assay of art, but at his touch,	
The greatest man in England but the King.             Exeunt	
The harvest is your own.	
The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?	
The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]	
The hearts of princes kiss obedience,	
The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.	
The holy suit which fain it would convince,	
The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say;	
The horned herd! For I have savage cause,	
The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear	
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,	
The issue of the next son should have reign'd.	
The least rub in your fortunes, fall away	
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;	
The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;	
The lethargy must have his quiet course.	
The letter is too long by half a mile.	
The life o' the building.	
The life thou gav'st me first was lost and done	
The lioness had torn some flesh away,	
The loss of those three lords torments my heart.	
The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,	
The manner of their taking may appear	
The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?	
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction	
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,	
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings	
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.	
The most convenient place that I can think of	
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion	
The multitudinous seas incarnadine,	
The narrow-prying father, Minola,	
The native act and figure of my heart	
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach	
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,	
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;	
The noble Antony.	
The noble Duke of Bedford, late deceas'd,	
The noble knot he made.	
The noble spirits to arms, they did perform	
The numbers of our host, and make discovery	
The oldest have borne most; we that are young	
The one is Caius Lucius.	
The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.	
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,	
The other way's a Mars.                         [To MARDIAN]	
The other, London.	
The passage and whole carriage of this action	
The past-proportion of his infinite,	
The pauses that he makes.	
The place which I have feasted, does it now,	
The plains near Rouen	
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon	
The plebeians have got your fellow tribune	
The plot of situation and the model,	
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,	
The present money to discharge the Jew,	
The preyful Princess pierc'd and prick'd a pretty pleasing	
The proof of it will turn to redder drops.	
The qualities of people. Come, my queen;	
The quality of persons, and the time;	
The queen of earthly queens. She's noble born;	
The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring	
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least,	
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,	
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.	
The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems	
The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks	
The same you are not, which for your best ends	
The sands are numb'red that make up my life;	
The scourge of greatness to be us'd on it-	
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head	
The second name of men, obeys his points	
The self-same way, with more advised watch,	
The senators with one consent of love	
The sense of reck'ning, if th' opposed numbers	
The several chairs of order look you scour	
The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva,	
The slavish motive of recanting fear,	
The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!	
The sleepy grooms with blood.	
The soldier that did company these three	
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss	
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend	
The source of all erection. There's more gold.	
The special head of all the land together-	
The spouse of any noble gentleman.	
The stamp of nobleness in any person	
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men. [Knocking within]	
The strain of strutting chanticleer	
The street in Windsor	
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.	
The street, near Leonato's house.	
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse-	
The sug'red game before thee. But myself,	
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,	
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch	
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;	
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy,	
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,	
The teeming autumn big with rich increase,	
The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms	
The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,	
The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp	
The time is fair again.	
The trap is laid for me!	
The trumpet sounds. Enter Worcester [and Vernon].	
The trumpets sound, and the KING enters with his nobles,	
The trumpets sound. Stand close, the Queen is coming.	
The trumpets sound. [Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,	
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.	
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.	
The unreasonable fury of a beast.	
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.	
The untimely emptying of the happy throne,	
The upper Germany, can dearly witness,	
The utmost man of expectation,	
The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.	
The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then	
The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,	
The very elements of this warlike isle,	
The very train of her worst wearing gown	
The villainy of our fears.	
The violence of either thee becomes,	
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,	
The washing of ten tides!	
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.	
The water swell before a boist'rous storm.	
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs	
The weary way hath made you melancholy.	
The which, [To AGAMEMNON] most mighty, for thy place and sway,	
The wild waves whist,	
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,	
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees	
The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes,	
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.	
The worst of words.	
The yearly course that brings this day about	
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.	
Their crownets regal from th' Athenian bay	
Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;	
Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that	
Their going hence, even as their coming hither;	
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.	
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,	
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock	
Their mother's bedchamber should not be safe	
Their scanted courtesy.	
Their several kinds have done. My high charms work,	
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,	
Their war-like fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains	
Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets	
Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,	
Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?	
Then 'tis but reason that I be releas'd	
Then all afire with me; the King's son, Ferdinand,	
Then at my suit look graciously on him;	
Then be it so. Heavens keep old Bedford safe!	
Then enter to his rescue BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS	
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.         Exit	
Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,	
Then in the number let me pass untold,	
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;	
Then must my earth with her continual tears	
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,	
Then take my soul-my body, soul, and all,	
Then tell us, shall your city call us lord	
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen	
Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve;	
Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush	
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much	
Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.	
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,	
Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd	
Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.	
Then, what it was that next came in her eye,	
There are a sort of men whose visages	
There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;	
There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?	
There are that dare; and I myself have ventur'd	
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him	
There died this morning of a cruel fever	
There had made a lasting spring.	
There is a soul counts thee her creditor,	
There is a vent of blood, and something blown;	
There is much care and valour in this Welshman.	
There is my gage, the manual seal of death	
There is no boot.	
There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.	
There lies your way, due west.	
There lives not three good men unhang'd in England; and one of	
There shall no figure at such rate be set	
There shall your master have a thousand loves,	
There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,	
There vanish'd in the sunbeams; which portends,	
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;	
There were so many-whom she may accuse.	
There would have been a time for such a word.	
There's her cousin, an she were not possess'd with a fury,exceeds	
There's livers out of Britain.	
There's money for thee; if you tarry longer	
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,	
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch	
There's reason he should be displeas'd at it.	
There's some among you have beheld me fighting;	
There, take thou that till thou bring better news.	
Thereby to see the minutes how they run-	
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.	
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.	
Therefore I urge thy oath. For that I know	
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,	
Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)	
Therefore draw for the supportance of his vow; he protests he	
Therefore heaven Nature charg'd	
Therefore let every man now task his thought	
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,	
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.	
Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,	
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.	
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,	
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;	
Thersites?	
These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.	
These blenches gave my heart another youth,	
These flies are couch'd.	
These hands do lack nobility, that they strike	
These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.	
These present wars against the Ottomites.	
These present-absent with swift motion slide.	
These quarrels must be quietly debated.	
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies;	
These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil-	
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.	
These two Antipholus', these two so like,	
These two young gentlemen that call me father,	
They are the faction. O Conspiracy,	
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,	
They cannot budge till your release. The King,	
They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase	
They come like sacrifices in their trim,	
They do it but in mocking merriment,	
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,	
They fight.	
They fight.	
They fight.	
They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em	
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;	
They know their master loves to be aloft,	
They lose it that do buy it with much care.	
They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,	
They march over and go out.  Alarums.  Then enter again, in skirmish,	
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?	
They prosper best of all when I am thence.	
They say best men moulded out of faults;	
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;	
They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.           Exeunt	
They think my little stomach to the war	
They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly	
They would but stink, and putrefy the air.	
They would restrain the one, distain the other.	
They'll open of themselves.  [Alarum far off]  Hark you far off!	
Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers	
Thieves! Thieves!	
Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,	
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,	
Thine own true knight,	
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,	
Things done undone; but if he be at hand,	
Think it a bastard whom the oracle	
Think on my words.                   Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES	
Think on the Tower and me. Despair, and die.	
Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,	
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?	
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man	
Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them	
Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits	
Thinking this voice an armed Englishman-	
This Cardinal's more haughty than the devil.	
This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.	
This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it,	
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;	
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.	
This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house	
This dangerous treason, lurking in our way	
This fair alliance quickly shall can home	
This favour will I do you for his sake;	
This flower's force in stirring love.	
This growing image of thy fiend-like face?	
This happy breed of men, this little world,	
This heavy-headed revel east and west	
This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,	
This his good melancholy oft began,	
This is All-Souls' day, fellow, is it not?	
This is a scurvy tune too; but here's my comfort.	
This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,	
This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,	
This is a trick to put me from my suit.	
This is it that makes me bridle passion	
This is not hunters' language. He that strikes	
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said	
This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;	
This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.	
This is the quondam King; let's seize upon him.	
This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.	
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,	
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;	
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.	
This morning to them.	
This murder had not come into my mind;	
This music mads me. Let it sound no more;	
This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,	
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue	
This night the siege assuredly I'll raise.	
This oracle of comfort has so pleas'd me	
This ornament of knighthood-yea or no.	
This palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd	
This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and	
This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;	
This prince in justice seizeth but his own.	
This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.	
This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;	
This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen	
This seen, Orlando did approach the man,	
This service is not service so being done,	
This sudden sending him away must seem	
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder	
This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.	
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head	
This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,	
This unprevailing woe, and think of us	
This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.	
This wicked Emperor may have shipp'd her hence;	
This widow lady? In her right we came;	
This world had air'd them. Hence I took a thought	
Thisby dear, and lady dear!'	
Thisby, is the better- he for a man, God warrant us: She for a	
Thither where more attends you; and you slander	
Thorough flood, thorough fire,	
Those bated that inherit but the fall	
Those be rubies, fairy favours,	
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own,	
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,	
Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults	
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took	
Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,	
Those that betray them do no treachery.	
Those that would mischief me than those that do!	
Those twins of learning that he rais'd in you,	
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;	
Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith,	
Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich.	
Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice-	
Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,	
Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,	
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud;	
Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them.	
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face	
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,	
Thou dost not slumber: see thy two sons' heads,	
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!	
Thou ever young, fresh, lov'd, and delicate wooer,	
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne	
Thou fall'st a blessed martyr!	
Thou foul accursed minister of hell!	
Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.	
Thou hadst, great King, a subject who	
Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,	
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.	
Thou hast robb'd me of this deed. I would revenges,	
Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,	
Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,	
Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air	
Thou knowest my old ward. Here I lay, and thus I bore my point.	
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!          Dies. Fleance escapes.	
Thou mightst be freed?	
Thou mov'st no less with thy complaining than	
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond	
Thou odoriferous stench! sound rottenness!	
Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,	
Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls.	
Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.	
Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,	
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.	
Thou shalt stand curs'd and excommunicate;	
Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;	
Thou shouldst not scape me here.	
Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb,	
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,	
Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose	
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,	
Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come.	
Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,	
Thou wear a lion's hide! Doff it for shame,	
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,	
Thou wondrous man.	
Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far	
Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him	
Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care	
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,	
Though I am bound to every act of duty,	
Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,	
Though his right arm might purchase his own time,	
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.	
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;	
Though to it self, it only live and die,	
Though you can guess what temperance should be,	
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,	
Though, I confess, much like the character;	
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,	
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves	
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,	
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word	
Three knights upon our party slain to-day,	
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.	
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,	
Three times they breath'd, and three times did they drink,	
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,	
Thrice-fam'd beyond, beyond all erudition;	
Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.	
Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,	
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!	
Throw over her the veil of infamy;	
Throw up thine eye! See, see what show'rs arise,	
Thunder. Second Apparition: a bloody Child.	
Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her	
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,	
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.	
Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,	
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.	
Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin	
Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.	
Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.	
Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural	
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.	
Thy foot to England's throne. And therefore mark:	
Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that	
Thy general is my lover. I have been	
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate	
Thy likeness; for instead of thee, King Harry,	
Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.	
Thy news?	
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax	
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,	
Thy sheep be in the corn;	
Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.	
Thy spirits are most tall.	
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.	
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,	
Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote	
Thy token of reprieve.	
Thy topless deputation he puts on;	
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,	
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,	
Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love	
Till I and my affairs are answered.	
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part	
Till it cry sleep to death.	
Till it fly out and show them princes born.           Exeunt	
Till one can do no more.	
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.	
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,	
Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,	
Till that the nature of your fault be known	
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.                 Exit.	
Till this man show'd thee? And what art thou now?	
Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth	
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields	
Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.	
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,	
Time's thievish progress to eternity.	
To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,	
To Desdemona hath tonight caroused	
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out	
To England will I steal, and there I'll steal;	
To Lucio] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,	
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away.	
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,	
To all the Duke of Norfolk's signiories,	
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,	
To answer all the debt he owes to you	
To answer us.	
To any shape of thy preferment, such	
To any well-deserving friend;	
To be a widow-maker! O, and there	
To be another's fool. I would be gone.	
To be contracted in one brow of woe,	
To be exalted with the threatening clouds,	
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,	
To be his purveyor; but he rides well,	
To be sent after me.	
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.	
To be the post, in hope of his reward.	
To be the same in thine own act and valor	
To be ungentle.	
To be your Regent in the realm of France.	
To be your Valentine.	
To bear his image and renew his glories!	
To bed, to bed! Sleep kill those pretty eyes,	
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;	
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,	
To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,	
To blot out me and put his own son in.	
To break it with a fearful dream of him,	
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much-	
To bring this matter to the wished end.	
To build his fortune I will strain a little,	
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.	
To buy you a better husband.	
To call a present court of Parliament.	
To carry into Flanders the great seal.	
To castigate thy pride, 'twere well; but thou	
To cavil in the course of this contract.	
To come near. [Exit GENTLEMAN] What can be their business	
To comfort you the more, I have receiv'd	
To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,	
To crop at once a too long withered flower.	
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.	
To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction.	
To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight	
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,	
To do him wrong, or any way impeach	
To do myself this reason and this right.	
To do no contrived murther. I lack iniquity	
To do this piece of ruthless butchery,	
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,	
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather	
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.	
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,	
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.	
To ease your country of distressful war,	
To eminent assistants, but spider-like,	
To enter conquerors, and to proclaim	
To envious and calumniating Time.	
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.	
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love	
To fight with Talbot; as he march'd along,	
To find out right with wrong-it may not be;	
To fly the favours of so good a king,	
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.	
To follow this fair corse unto her grave.	
To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'	
To frustrate both his oath and what beside	
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,	
To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.	
To give thee answer of thy just demand.	
To give their bed joy and prosperity?	
To give you over at this first encounter,	
To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,	
To groan and sweat under the business,	
To have a giant's strength! But it is tyrannous	
To have a godly peace concluded of	
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me	
To have her name repeated; all her deserving	
To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair	
To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!	
To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!	
To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,	
To help me sort such needful ornaments	
To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back'd toad.	
To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father;	
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot	
To his conveyance I assign my wife,	
To his experienc'd tongue-yet let it please both,	
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English,	
To his own portion! And what expense by th' hour	
To his own use he keeps, and sends me word	
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,	
To honour Helen, and to be her knight!                  Exit	
To imitate them: faults that are rich are fair.	
To incur a private check. When shall he come?	
To jump a body with a dangerous physic	
To keep her constancy in plight and youth,	
To keep it builded be the ram to batter	
To keep them back that come to succour you.	
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,	
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when	
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;	
To knaves and all approachers. 'Tis most just	
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.	
To know the cause of your abrupt departure.	
To lay on me a cruelty by taking	
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax	
To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream	
To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than	
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work-	
To leave the city and commit yourself	
To let me see them, and to make me know	
To lie in watch there, and to think on him?	
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.	
To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.	
To lose an oath to win a paradise?'	
To make a false one.	
To make a more requital to your love!	
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?	
To make a world-without-end bargain in.	
To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.	
To make confession and to be absolv'd.	
To make that worse, suff'red his kinsman March	
To make theirs ours, and ours none but our own;	
To make us strangers to his looks of love.	
To me she's married, not unto my clothes.	
To meet anon, upon your approbation.	
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.	
To melt myself away in water drops!	
To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully	
To my demands. Why do you pity me?	
To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell	
To one that would do thus. I am half through:	
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?	
To outlook conquest, and to will renown	
To parley or to fight, therefore prepare.	
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.	
To pray Achilles see us at our tent.	
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.	
To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd	
To quit this horrid act.	
To reave the orphan of his patrimony,	
To reconcile you all unto the King.                   Exeunt	
To render them redoubted. Look on beauty	
To revel it with him and his new bride.	
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?	
To rob me of so rich a bottom here.	
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.	
To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.	
To ruminate on this so far, until	
To say I have done no harm -What are these faces?	
To say to me that thou art out of breath?	
To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes	
To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,	
To see if any mean to shrink from me.                 Exeunt	
To see me thus transformed to a boy.	
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.	
To send me packing with an host of men.	
To set a form upon desired change,	
To set thee here?	
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' th' wars	
To shape my legs of an unequal size;	
To shine on my contemptible estate.	
To shoot another arrow that self way	
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.	
To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,	
To sit here at this present, and behold	
To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!	
To some retention and appointed guard;	
To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so:	
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.	
To stand upon my kingdom once again.	
To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames	
To start my quiet.	
To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span	
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come	
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too;	
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.	
To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,	
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.	
To take the one the other, by some chance,	
To take this offer; but Mark Antony	
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air,	
To tell him that his sword can never win	
To tell this story, that you might excuse	
To temper poisons for her; still pretending	
To th' Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?	
To th' utmost of a man, and giddy censure	
To the King's party there's no going. Newness	
To the great lord.	
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.	
To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.	
To the perpetual wink for aye might put	
To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel	
To the whole race of mankind, high and low!	
To their approvers they are people such	
To their benumbed wills, resist the same;	
To them accordingly.	
To think me as well a sister as a wife,	
To think, when thou shalt be disedg'd by her	
To this detested groom.                 [Points at Oswald.]	
To this most cruel act, do but despair;	
To this same blessed Milford. And by th' way	
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer-	
To those of mine!	
To those that make us both- fair ladies, you;	
To throw away the dearest thing he owed	
To throw down Hector than Polyxena.	
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:	
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;	
To thy sweet will making addition thus.	
To tie thee to my strong correction.	
To trade and traffic with Macbeth	
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,	
To tremble under Titus' threat'ning look.	
To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists	
To try if thou be current gold indeed.	
To try my fortune. By this scimitar,	
To tumble down thy husband and thyself	
To undergo such ample grace and honour,	
To use between your strangeness and his pride,	
To use it like a giant.	
To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.	
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward;	
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,	
To wear a heart so white. [Knocking within.] I hear knocking	
To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,	
To weep is to make less the depth of grief.	
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,	
To whom I will retail my conquest won,	
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,	
To whom we all rest generally beholding.	
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy	
To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,	
To woo a maid in way of marriage;	
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul	
To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;	
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.	
To-night at Heme's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,	
To-night we'll wander through the streets and note	
Tongue, and brain not; either both or nothing,	
Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her-	
Touch me alike; th' are breath I not believe in.	
Touches his friend, which craves to be rememb'red	
Traveller. O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!	
Treachery! Seek it out.	
Treason is not inherited, my lord;	
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!	
Troilus for a copper nose.	
Troyan drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent. I'll after.	
Troyan-now the sleeve, now the sleeve!	
Troyans that thou dream'st not of, the which for sport sake are	
True nobility is exempt from fear:	
True swains in love shall in the world to come	
Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER below	
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.	
Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt	
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;	
Try fortune with him in a single fight.	
Tucket within.	
Turn him to any cause of policy,	
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,	
Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things	
Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat	
Twice being by the people chosen censor,	
Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath	
Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.	
Two of both kinds makes up four.	
Two other like Gentlemen	
Two several times by night; at Sardis once,	
Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.	
ULYSSES. How now, Troyan!	
ULYSSES. How now, my lord?	
ULYSSES. I cannot conjure, Troyan.	
ULYSSES. I wonder now how yonder city stands,	
ULYSSES. Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.	
ULYSSES. Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure	
ULYSSES. Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,	
ULYSSES. This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,	
ULYSSES. Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,	
ULYSSES. You are moved, Prince; let us depart, I pray,	
ULYSSES. You have sworn patience.	
Unarm thee, go; and doubt thou not, brave boy,	
Uncertain of the issue any way.	
Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.	
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;	
Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.	
Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;	
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,	
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.	
Under the canopies of costly state,	
Under the lordly monarch of the north,	
Under the walls of Alexandria	
Under your promis'd pardon. The subjects' grief	
Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both	
Unguided and unfriended, often prove	
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.	
Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about	
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,	
Unless my sins abuse my divination,	
Unless she do it under this excuse,	
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,	
Unless the deed go with it. From this moment	
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;	
Unless this general evil they maintain,	
Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails	
Unpleasing to a married ear!	
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.	
Unseparable, shall within this hour,	
Unshaked of motion; and that I am he,	
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed	
Until four hundred one and twenty years	
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.	
Until the white rose that I wear be dy'd	
Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style	
Unto the voice and yielding of that body	
Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun-	
Up, Princes, and, with spirit of honour edged	
Upbraid my falsehood when th' have said 'As false	
Upon himself.                       Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS	
Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;	
Upon mine honour, for a silken point	
Upon my body with their hellish charms?	
Upon my faith and honour.	
Upon my life, began her devilish practices;	
Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;	
Upon one battle all our liberties.	
Upon our honours?	
Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people	
Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,	
Upon our territories, and have already	
Upon such large terms and so absolute	
Upon the fortune of this present year;	
Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,	
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;	
Upon the hill of Basan to outroar	
Upon the innocent and aweless throne.	
Upon the life of this thrice-famed Duke.	
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.	
Upon the next occasion that we meet	
Upon what cause, wrong you? Alas, our places,

Urs. You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very	
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died	
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;	
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.	
VALENTINE, gentleman attending on the Duke	
VALERIA. In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news	
VINCENTIO. Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?	
VINCENTIO. What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy	
VIOLA. And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,	
VIOLA. I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the list of my	
VIOLA. I left no ring with her; what means this lady?	
VIOLA. I understand you, sir; 'tis well begg'd.	
VIOLA. I'll do my best	
VIOLA. Most sweet lady-	
VIOLA. My father had a mole upon his brow.	
VIOLA. On your attendance, my lord, here.	
VIOLA. The rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my	
VIOLA. Yes, being kept together and put to use.	
VIOLA. You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me;	
VIRGILIA. Ay, and mine,	
VIRGILIA. But had he died in the business, madam, how then?	
VIRGILIA. Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything	
VIRGILIA. Indeed, madam?	
VIRGILIA. Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.	
VOLUMNIA, mother to Coriolanus	
VOLUMNIA. He had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds	
VOLUMNIA. He must and will.	
VOLUMNIA. I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more

Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is;	
WARWICK. Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!	
WARWICK. And I choose Clarence only for Protector.	
WARWICK. As surely as my soul intends to live	
WARWICK. Away even now, or I will drag thee hence.	
WARWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;	
WARWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.	
WARWICK. Father, the Duke hath told the truth;	
WARWICK. From worthy Edward, King of Albion,	
WARWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;	
WARWICK. No, 'tis impossible he should escape;	
WARWICK. Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,	
WARWICK. O passing traitor, perjur'd and unjust!	
WARWICK. Roam thither then.	
WARWICK. Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king;

WESTMORELAND. That is intended in the general's name.	
WESTMORELAND. When ever yet was your appeal denied;	
WHITMORE. Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?	
WHITMORE. Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.	
WIDOW. Ay, marry, is't. Hark you! They come this way.	
WIDOW. Marry, hang you!

WILLIAMS. But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a

WOLSEY. There's fresher air, my lord,

WOODVILLE the Lieutenant speaks within]	
Wales. Before Flint Castle	
Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?'	
Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Calais;	
Warwick may lose that now hath won the day.	
Was either pitied in him or forgotten.	
Was force perforce compell'd to banish him,	
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know	
Was it not to refresh the mind of man	
Was never call'd to bear my part,	
Was not incensed by his subtle mother	
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent	
Was that my father that went hence so fast?	
Was the first man that leapt; cried 'Hell is empty,	
Was this King Priam's joy?'	
Was, were he evil us'd, he would outgo	
Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,	
Water with berries in't, and teach me how	
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.	
We are fit to bid her welcome.              Exit GENTLEWOMAN	
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;	
We cannot feel too little, hear too much.	
We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.	
We do instate and widow you withal	
We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy.	
We have made to endure friends, that you directly	
We have record that very well it can;	
We hold our town for neither, yet for both.	
We in your motion turn, and you may move us.	
We kept together in our chivalry.'	
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.	
We lose it not so long as we can smile.	
We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,	
We must extend our notice. Our dear son,	
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,	
We now present. Those that can pity here	
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,	
We scorn her most when most she offers blows.         Exeunt	
We sent our schoolmaster; is 'a come back?	
We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;	
We set the axe to thy usurping root;	
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.	
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,	
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.	
We split, we split! Farewell, my wife and children!	
We three here part that ne'er shall meet again.	
We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,	
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy	
We will establish our estate upon	
We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow.	
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,	
We will in France, by God's grace, play a set	
We would as willingly give cure as know.	
We'll all present ourselves; dis-horn the spirit,	
We'll follow them with all the power we have.	
We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?	
We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.	
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.	
We'll lay before this town our royal bones,	
We'll no more meet, no more see one another.	
We'll not offend one stomach with our play.	
We'll pass the business privately and well.	
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence	
We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.	
We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake	
We'll try with tongue too. If none will do, let her remain; but	
Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands	
Welcome before the gates of Angiers, Duke.	
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas,	
Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,	
Well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.	
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,	
Were but my trials of thy love, and thou	
Were but one danger, and to keep him here	
Were he the butcher of my son, he should	
Were it a casque compos'd by Vulcan's skill	
Were it not sinful then striving to mend,	
Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres;	
Were not revenge sufficient for me;	
Were piety in thine, it is in these.	
Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on,	
Were the graced person of our Banquo present,	
Were thy commixtion Greek and Troyan so	
Were to remember that the present need	
Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,	
West. This, match'd with other, did, my gracious lord;	
Westminster. The palace	
What I have said- Bianca, get you in;	
What Venus did with Mars.	
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?	
What brings you here to court so hastily?	
What cannot be eschew'd must be embrac'd.	
What cannot be preserved when Fortune takes,	
What could the belly answer?	
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?	
What else may hap to time I will commit;	
What friendship may I do thee?	
What further you will do.	
What great creation and what dole of honour	
What grief hath set these jaundies o'er your cheeks?	
What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove	
What hath proceeded worthy note today.	
What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?	
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;	
What if my house be troubled with a rat,	
What if this mixture do not work at all?	
What is become of her.	
What is her name?	
What is it but to make thy sepulchre	
What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,	
What is not holy, that we swear not by,	
What is thy name? Discuss.	
What is unsettled in the King.	
What is your name?	
What is your pleasure with me?	
What is't thou canst demand?	
What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,	
What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia	
What louring star now envies thy estate	
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?	
What masque? what music? How shall we beguile	
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,	
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?	
What merit lived in me that you should love	
What our contempts doth often hurl from us	
What said my man when my betossed soul	
What says Lord Warwick? Shall we after them?	
What says he of our marriage? What of that?	
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?	
What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth.	
What should this mean?	
What think you of a duchess? Have you limbs	
What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,	
What we can do to him-though now the time	
What will be said? What mockery will it be	
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,	
What yesternight our Council did decree	
What you have done, before our army hear me.	
What you have said and show yourselves true Romans.	
What you have seen him do and heard him speak,	
What you would work me to, I have some aim.	
What! a speaker is but a prater: a rhyme is but a ballad. A good	
What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;	
What's yet behind that's meet you all should know.	
What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!	
What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf?	
What, art thou stiff? Stand'st out?	
What, billing again? Here's 'In witness whereof the parties	
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.	
What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?	
What, have you given him any hard words of late?	
What, is it a time to jest and dally now?	
What, old acquaintance? Could not all this flesh	
What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.	
What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]	
Whatever torment you do put me to.	
When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams."	
When I am in my coach, which stays for us	
When I did first impart my love to you,	
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.	
When I have envied thy behaviour.	
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,	
When I have found it. The Count he woos your daughter	
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,	
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain	
When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name	
When I was dry with rage and extreme toll,	
When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?	
When all's spent, he'd be cross'd then, an he could.	
When articles too nicely urg'd be stood on.	
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,	
When at their mothers' moist'ned eyes babes shall suck,	
When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;	
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.	
When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce	
When by the Archbishop of Canterbury	
When daisies pied and violets blue	
When every private widow well may keep,	
When flesh is cheap and females dear,	
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds	
When he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood.	
When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,	
When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,	
When he th' ambitious Norway combated.	
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.	
When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?	
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear	
When it is least expected.	
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones.	
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,	
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.	
When man was wish'd to love his enemies!	
When men were fond, I smil'd and wond'red how.          Exit	
When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.	
When others sleep upon their quiet beds,	
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,	
When sapless age and weak unable limbs	
When sects and factions were newly born.	
When she did starve the general world beside	
When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,	
When such a sacred king should hide his head!	
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,	
When the rash mood is on.	
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.	
When there is in it but one only man.	
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.	
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?	
When they were living, warm'd themselves on thine!	
When thou dost hear I am as I have been,	
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,	
When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,	
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!	
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended	
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,	
When we are both accoutred like young men,	
When with a volley of our needless shot,	
When yet you were in place and in account	
When you yourself did part them.	
When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know not,	
When't pleas'd you to employ me.	
Where Charles the Great, having subdu'd the Saxons,	
Where Helen is the subject. Then, I say,	
Where I may have fruition of her love.	
Where I will walk till thou return to me.	
Where Love is thron'd.	
Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend.	
Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawk.	
Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?	
Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.	
Where gold; and no man that hath a name	
Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?	
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, do you know?	
Where is my Lord of Gloucester?	
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?	
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,	
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.	
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;	
Where money is; and I no question make	
Where my poor young was lim'd, was caught, and kill'd.	
Where no man never comes but that sad dog	
Where one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,	
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;	
Where th' are extended; who, like an arch, reverb'rate	
Where the bee sucks, there suck I;	
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him	
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour;	
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed	
Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?	
Where's his examination?	
Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm'd, rushes	
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,	
Where, but even now, with strange and several noises	
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed	
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore	
Wherefore was that cry?	
Wherefore you are not paid.	
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.	
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?	
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;	
Wherein have you been galled by the King;	
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.	
Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd	
Wherein you range under this subtile king!	
Wherein you're happy- which will make him know	
Wherein your lady and your humble wife	
Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,	
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.	
Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,	
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,	
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd	
Whether they live or die.	
Whether those peals of praise be his or no;	
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.	
Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin,	
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.	
Which I had recommended to his use	
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor.	
Which I have open'd to his Grace at large,	
Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.	
Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke	
Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,	
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.	
Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion	
Which argued thee a most unloving father.	
Which at more leisure I will so excuse	
Which being shallow, you shall give me leave	
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;	
Which calls me pupil or hath read to me?	
Which can interpret farther; only I say	
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not	
Which craves as desperate an execution	
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,	
Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.	
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd	
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads.	
Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,	
Which hath our several honours all engag'd	
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;	
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,	
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered.	
Which his triumphant father's hand had won.	
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,	
Which in the very meeting fall and die!	
Which is as bad as die with tickling.	
Which is his only.	
Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,	
Which is not tomb enough and continent	
Which is the better man, the greater throw	
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!	
Which is- no, no- which was the fairest dame	
Which join'd with him and made their march for	
Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.	
Which makes my whit'st part black. The will of heav'n	
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,	
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd	
Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,	
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason	
Which must approve thee honest. 'If Pisanio	
Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left	
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself	
Which now goes too free-footed.	
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,	
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,	
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,	
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?	
Which on thy royal party granted once,	
Which once in him abated, an the rest	
Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on;	
Which owe the crown that thou o'er-masterest?	
Which rather threaten'st than dost promise aught,	
Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!	
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath	
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.	
Which shall to all our nights and days to come	
Which she did use as she was writing of it,	
Which she must dote on in extremity.	
Which should not find a ground to root upon	
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,	
Which still should go with Antony.	
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent	
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;	
Which the commission of thy years and art	
Which thou dost glare with.	
Which thou owedst yesterday.	
Which to his former strength may be restored	
Which to recure, we heartily solicit	
Which to repair should be thy chief desire:	
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?	
Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,	
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,	
Which was, that he, in lieu o' th' premises,	
Which we have done, whose answer would be death,	
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,	
Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world	
Which when I saw, I reprehended them,	
Which with experimental seal doth warrant	
Which wrought to his desire.	
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,	
Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him	
Which, as immediate from thy place and blood,	
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart	
Which, like unruly children, make their sire	
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows	
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.	
Which, touching but my gentle vessel's side,	
Which, with pain purchas'd, doth inherit pain,	
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?	
While I spare speech, which something now offends me-	
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.	
While other jests are something rank on foot,	
While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.	
While we return these dukes what we decree.	
Whiles I go tell my lord the Emperor	
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!	
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.	
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,	
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee, Bolingbroke!'	
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,	
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,	
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,	
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,	
Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,	
Whilst you abide here.	
Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break.	
Whither I go, thither shall you go too;	
Whither away, or where is thy abode?	
Whither were you a-going?	
Who after me hath many a weary step	
Who builds his hope in air of your good looks	
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree	
Who dares do more is none.	
Who has a charter to extol her blood,	
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning	
Who hither come engaged by my oath-	
Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,	
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.	
Who is as free from touch or soil with her	
Who is thy grandfather; he made those clothes,	
Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt	
Who led me instantly unto his cave,	
Who lets go by no vantages that may	
Who long'st like me to see thy lord, who long'st-	
Who needs must know of her departure and	
Who painfully with much expedient march	
Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,	
Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?	
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil	
Who will not change a raven for a dove?	
Who with them was a rated sinew too	
Who's here? Speak, ho! No answer? What is this?	
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,	
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him	
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,	
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,	
Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves	
Who, tend'ring their own worth from where they were glass'd,	
Who, when he knows thou art the Empress' babe,	
Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.	
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,	
Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know	
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,	
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-	
Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,	
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,	
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.	
Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours-	
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,	
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,	
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof,	
Whom, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen-	
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity	
Whose absence is no less material to me	
Whose arms were moulded in their mother's womb	
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,	
Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King	
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,	
Whose duty is deceivable and false.	
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills	
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted	
Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul	
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes;	
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides	
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts	
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth	
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?	
Whose heart within his bosom is.	
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.	
Whose honour Heaven shield from soil!-even he escapes not	
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms	
Whose icy current and compulsive course	
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,	
Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart;	
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall	
Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort,	
Whose nature is so far from doing harms	
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd	
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouth'd sea,	
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect	
Why Somerset should be preferr'd in this.	
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,	
Why art thou old, and want'st experience?	
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,	
Why dost thou say King Richard is depos'd?	
Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack	
Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,	
Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'	
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks	
Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?	
Why she dares not come over to thee.	
Why should excuse be born or ere begot?	
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?	
Why tender'st thou that paper to me with	
Why then defy each other, and pell-mell	
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,	
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again	
Why with the time do I not glance aside	
Why write I still all one, ever the same,	
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'	
Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,	
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?	
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st	
Why, that you are my daughter?	
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house!	
Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:	
Why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's name.	
Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth	
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.	
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;	
Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.	
Will I apply that treats of happiness	
Will I with wine and wassail so convince	
Will You walk out of the air, my lord?	
Will answer in mine honour.	
Will be deceiv'd; for, gentle hearers, know,	
Will even weigh; and both as light as tales.	
Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,	
Will issue out again and bid us battle;	
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?	
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.	
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.	
Will not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't,	
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.	
Will not confess he owes the malady	
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,	
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,	
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.	
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,	
Will you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so.	
Will you go see her?	
Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?	
Will you sit down?	
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?	
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil	
Wilt thou destroy him then?	
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for	
Windsor Castle	
Windsor Park	
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste;	
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up;	
Wish we all joy and honour.	
Witch's mummy, maw and gulf	
With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,	
With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch of Eie,	
With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.	
With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?	
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;	
With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak;	
With all his covent, honourably receiv'd him;	
With all licentious measure, making your wills	
With all religious strength of sacred vows;	
With all swift speed you must away to France.	
With all the choicest music of the kingdom,	
With all the strength and armour of the mind	
With all triumphant splendour on my brow,	
With an attent ear, till I may deliver	
With an incensed fire of injuries.	
With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as	
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.	
With better appetite.	
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design	
With carrion men, groaning for burial.	
With character too gross, is writ on Juliet.	
With downright payment show'd unto my father.	
With drunken spilth of wine, when every room	
With eye-offending brine; all this to season	
With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine	
With foreheads villainous low.	
With full as many signs of deadly hate,	
With giving him glory.	
With half that face would he have all my land:	
With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flow'rs,	
With haughty arms this hateful name in us.	
With her to thee; and this addition more,	
With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;	
With holy breath.	
With hope to find the like event in love	
With juice of balm and every precious flower;	
With lustier maintenance than I did look for	
With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,	
With manacles through our streets, or else	
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.	
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?	
With most delicious poison. Think on me,	
With new lamenting ancient oversights.	
With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me	
With one that saw him die, who did report	
With other graces weigh'd.	
With pay and thanks; and let's away to London	
With pity that doth make me sick! A lady	
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.	
With precepts that would make invincible	
With profits of the mind, study and fast.	
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen	
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;	
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous	
With senators on the bench. This is it	
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,	
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere	
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,	
With spans and inches so diminutive	
With strife to please you, day exceeding day.	
With such austerity as longeth to a father.	
With such holiness can you do it?	
With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness;	
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,	
With that suit upon my back will I ravish her; first kill him,	
With that which, but by being so retir'd,	
With them a bastard of the king's deceas'd;	
With these our late-deceased Emperor's sons:	
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains	
With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,	
With tokens thus and thus; averring notes	
With too much riches it confound itself;	
With too much urging your pernicious lives,	
With true-love showers.	
With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruis'd,	
With untired spirits and formal constancy.	
With walking once about the quadrangle,	
With what a majesty he bears himself;	
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails	
With winds that sailors rail at.	
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;	
Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,	
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;	
Within these ten days if that thou beest found	
Without control lusted to make a prey.	
Without debatement further, more or less,	
Without observance or respect of any,	
Without the peril of the Athenian law-	
Without the privity o' th' King-t' appoint	
Without the sensible and true avouch	
Without the walls of Florence	
Witness against us to damnation!	
Witness this army of such mass and charge,	
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,

Would he not be a comfort to our travel?	
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,	
Would in so just a business shut his bosom	
Would make a volume of enticing lines,

Would so offend a virgin, and extort

Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,	
Yet grace must still look so.	
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.

Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.	
Yet never have you tasted our reward,	
Yet one thing more, good Captain, do for me-	
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.	
Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him	
Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,	
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?	
Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,	
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,	
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.	
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this	
Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see	
Yet, for your part, it not appears to me,	
Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce

Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,

Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!	
York!	
You are a thousand times a properer man	
You are both sure, and will assist me?	
You are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.	
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind	
You are the king King Edward hath depos'd;	
You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt	
You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.	
You break no privilege nor charter there.	
You came not of one mother then, it seems.	
You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,	
You cast th' event of war, my noble lord,	
You do appear before them; if they shall chance,	
You envy my advancement and my friends';	
You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with thankfulness.	
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,	
You have now a broken banquet, but we'll mend it.	
You know not what it is.	
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.	
You know, my lord, your Highness is betroth'd	
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience	
You leer upon me, do you? There's an eye	
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;	
You may behold confusion of your foes.                  Exit	
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom	
You may imagine him upon Blackheath;	
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,	
You may not come, fair Princess, within my gates;	
You men will never tarry.	
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.	
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.	
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;	
You of your wife, and me of my consent,	
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,	
You see the poor remainder-could distribute,	
You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.	
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day	
You should be satisfied.	
You speedy helpers that are substitutes	
You spurn'd me such a day; another time	
You that are honest, by being what you are,	
You were best meddle with buck-washing.	
You were conducted to a gentle bath	
You were now running o'er. You have scarce time	
You would have bid me argue like a father.	
You would have followed.	
You would have married her most shamefully,	
You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;	
You, as your business and desires shall point you,	
You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking	
Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,	
Young York he is but boot, because both they

Young men will do't if they come to't	
Your Grace's pardon; and I hope I had it.	
Your Highness knows, comes to no further use	
Your answer had not been inscroll'd.

Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.	
Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas'-	
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,	
Your colder reasons.	
Your daughter here the princes left for dead,	
Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men	
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,	
Your gates against my force. Yet, for I lov'd thee,	
Your heart has mind to.                               Exeunt	
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;	
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.	
Your honourable letter he desires	
Your hopes and friends are infinite.	
Your ignorance- which finds not till it feels,	
Your legs did better service than your hands.	
Your letter is with Jupiter by this.	
Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,	
Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,	
Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people	
Your master's confidence was above mine,	
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-	
Your mystery, your mystery; nay, dispatch.           Exit Emilia.	
Your noble and right well-rememb'red father's?	
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,	
Your power and your command is taken off,	
Your su'd-for tongues?	
Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.	
Your sword upon a woman?	
Your unfortunate son,	
Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you	
Yourself shall feast with us before you go,	
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.
